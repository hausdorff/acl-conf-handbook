Abstract#==#More and more of the information on the web
is dialogic, from Facebook newsfeeds, to forum
conversations, to comment threads on
news articles. In contrast to traditional NLP
resources such as news, highly social dialogue
is frequent in these genres, making them a
challenging context for NLP. This paper tests
a bootstrapping method of training classifiers
to identify turns in dialogue that are either sarcastic
or nasty. We explore two methods of
developing linguistic indicators to be used in a
first level classifier aimed at maximizing precision
at the expense of recall. The best performing
classifier for the first phase achieves
54% precision and 38% recall for sarcastic utterances.
We then bootstrap from the utterances
identified as sarcastic by using general
syntactic patterns to create more general sarcasm
indicators, improving precision to 62%
and recall to 52%. We apply the same method
to bootstrapping a classifier for nastiness dialogic
acts. Our first phase, using crowdsourced
nasty indicators, achieves 58% precision
and 49% recall, which increases to 75%
precision and 62% recall when we bootstrap
over phase one with generalized syntactic patterns.
