Abstract#==#Deciding whether a synchronous grammar
formalism generates a given word alignment
(the alignment coverage problem) depends on
finding an adequate instance grammar and
then using it to â€œparse" the word alignment.
But what does it mean to parse a word alignment
by a synchronous grammar? This is formally
undefined until we define an unambiguous
mapping between grammatical derivations
and word-level alignments. This paper
proposes an initial, formal characterization
of alignment coverage as intersecting two
partially ordered sets (graphs) of translation
equivalence units, one derived by a grammar
instance and another defined by the word
alignment. As a first application, we report extensive
coverage results for ITG on automatic
and manual alignments. Even for the ITG formalism,
our formal characterization makes explicit
many of the algorithmic choices often left underspecified
in earlier work.
