Abstract#==#Selecting a set of nonterminals for the synchronous CFGs underlying the
hierarchical phrase-based models is usually done on the basis of a monolingual
resource (like a syntactic parser). However, a standard bilingual resource like
word alignments is itself rich with reordering patterns that, if clustered
somehow, might provide labels of different (possibly complementary) nature to
monolingual labels. In this paper we explore a first version of this idea based
on a hierarchical decomposition of word alignments into recursive tree
representations. We identify five clusters of alignment patterns in which the
children of a node in a decomposition tree are found and employ these five as
nonterminal labels for the Hiero productions. Although this is our first
non-optimized instantiation of the idea, our experiments show competitive
performance with the Hiero baseline, exemplifying certain merits of this novel
approach.
