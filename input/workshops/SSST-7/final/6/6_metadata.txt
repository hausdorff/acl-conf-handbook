Abstract#==#The statistical machine translation (SMT) system heavily depends on the
sentence aligned parallel corpus and the target language model. This paper
points out some of the core issues on switching a language script and its
repercussion in the phrase based statistical machine translation system
development. The present
task reports on the outcome of English-Manipuri language pair phrase based SMT
task on two aspects â€“ a) Manipuri using Bengali script, b) Manipuri using
transliterated Meetei Mayek script. Two independent views on Bengali script
based SMT and transliterated Meitei Mayek based SMT systems of the training
data and language models are presented and compared. The impact of various
language models is commendable in such scenario. The BLEU and NIST score shows
that Bengali script based phrase based SMT(PBSMT) outperforms over the Meetei
Mayek based English to Manipuri SMT system. However, subjective evaluation
shows slight
variation against the automatic scores.
