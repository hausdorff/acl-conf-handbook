Abstract#==#We show that combining both bottom-up rule chunking and top-down rule
segmentation search strategies in purely unsupervised learning of phrasal
inversion transduction grammars yields significantly better translation
accuracy than either strategy alone. Previous approaches have relied on
incrementally building larger rules by chunking smaller rules bottom-up; we
introduce a complementary top-down model that incrementally builds shorter
rules by segmenting larger rules. Specifically, we combine iteratively chunked
rules from Saers et al. (2012) with our new iteratively segmented rules. These
integrate seamlessly because both stay strictly within a pure transduction
grammar framework inducing under matching models during both training and
testing---instead of decoding under a completely different model architecture
than what is assumed during the training phases, which violates an elementary
principle of machine learning and statistics. To be able to drive induction
top-down, we introduce a minimum description length objective that trades off
maximum likelihood against model size. We show empirically that combining the
more liberal rule chunking model with a more conservative rule segmentation
model results in significantly better translations than either strategy in
isolation.
