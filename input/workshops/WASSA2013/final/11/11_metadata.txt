Abstract#==#Sentiment analysis means to extract opinion of users from review documents.
Sentiment classification using Machine Learning (ML) methods faces the problem
of high dimensionality of feature vector. Therefore, a feature selection method
is required to eliminate the irrelevant and noisy features from the feature
vector for efficient working of ML algorithms. Rough Set Theory based feature
selection method finds the optimal feature subset by eliminating the redundant
features. In this paper, Rough Set Theory (RST) based feature selection method
is applied for sentiment classification. A Hybrid feature selection method
based on RST and Information Gain (IG) is proposed for sentiment
classification. Proposed methods are evaluated on four standard datasets viz.
Movie review, product (book, DVD and electronics) review dataset. Experimental
results show that Hybrid feature selection method outperforms than other
feature selection methods for sentiment classification.
