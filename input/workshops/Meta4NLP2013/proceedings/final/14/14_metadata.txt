Abstract#==#This work presents the tentative version of the protocol designed for
annotation of a Russian metaphor corpus using the rapid annotation tool BRAT.
The first part of the article is devoted to the procedure of "shallow"
annotation in which metaphor-related words are identified according to a
slightly modified version of the MIPVU procedure. The paper presents the
results of two reliability tests and the measures of inter-annotator agreement
obtained in them. Further on, the article gives a brief account of the
linguistic problems that were encountered in adapting MIPVU to Russian. The
rest of the first part describes the classes of metaphor-related words and the
rules of their annotation with BRAT. The examples of annotation show how the
visualization functionalities of BRAT allow the researcher to describe the
multifaceted nature of metaphor related words and the complexity of their
relations.
The second part of the paper speaks about the annotation of conceptual
metaphors (the "deep" annotation), where formulations of conceptual metaphors
are inferred from the basic and contextual meanings of metaphor-related words
from the "shallow" annotation, which is expected to make the metaphor
formulation process more controllable.
