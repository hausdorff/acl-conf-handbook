Abstract#==#The paper presents an experimental algorithm to detect conventionalized
metaphors implicit in the lexical data in a resource like WordNet, where
metaphors are coded into the senses and so would never be detected by any
algorithm based on the violation of preferences, since there would always be a
constraint satisfied by such senses. We report an implementation of this
algorithm, which was implemented first the preference constraints in VerbNet.
We then derived in a systematic way a far more extensive set of constraints
based on WordNet glosses, and with this data we reimplemented the detec- tion
algorithm and got a substantial improvement in recall. We suggest that this
technique could contribute to improve the performance of existing metaphor
detec- tion strategies that do not attempt to detect convention- alized
metaphors. The new WordNet-derived data is of wider significance because it
also contains adjective constraints, unlike any existing lexical resource, and
can be applied to any language with a semantic parser (and WN) for it.
