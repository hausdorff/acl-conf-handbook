Abstract#==#What influences the likelihood that a word will be used metaphorically? We
tested whether the likelihood of metaphorical use is related to the
relationality of a wordâ€™s mean-ing. Relational words name relations between
entities. We predicted that relational words, such as verbs (e.g., speak) and
relational nouns (e.g., marriage) would be more likely to be used
metaphorically than words that name entities (e.g., item). In two experiments,
we collected expert ratings of metaphoricity for uses of verbs, relational
nouns, and entity nouns collected from a corpus search. As pre-dicted, uses of
relational words were rated as more metaphorical than uses of entity words. We
discuss how these findings could inform NLP models of metaphor.
