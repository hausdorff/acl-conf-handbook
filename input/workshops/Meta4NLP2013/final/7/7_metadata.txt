Abstract#==#Metaphor is a pervasive feature of human language that enables us to
conceptualize and communicate abstract concepts using more concrete
terminology. Unfortunately, it is also a feature that serves to confound a
computerâ€™s ability to comprehend natural human language. We present a method
to detect linguistic metaphors by inducing a domain-aware semantic signature
for a given text and comparing this signature against a large index of known
metaphors. By training a suite of binary classifiers using the results of
several semantic signature-based rankings of the index, we are able to detect
linguistic metaphors in unstructured text at a significantly higher precision
as compared to several baseline approaches.
