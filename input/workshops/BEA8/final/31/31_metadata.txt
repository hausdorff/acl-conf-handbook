Abstract#==#This paper reports our contribution to the 2013 NLI Shared Task. The purpose of
the task was to train a machine-learning system to identify the native-language
affiliations of 1,100 texts written in English by nonnative speakers as part of
a high-stakes test of gen- eral academic English proficiency. We trained our
system on the new TOEFL11 corpus, which includes 11,000 essays written by
nonnative speakers from 11 native-language backgrounds. Our final system used
an SVM classifier with over 400,000 unique features consisting of lexical and
POS n-grams occur- ring in at least two texts in the training set. Our system
identified the correct native- language affiliations of 83.6% of the texts in
the test set. This was the highest classification accuracy achieved in the 2013
NLI Shared Task.
