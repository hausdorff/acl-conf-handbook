Abstract#==#Native language identification (NLI) is the task to determine the native
language of the author based on an essay written in a second language.             
NLI is
often treated as a classification problem.  Most of previous works,
International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) is used to develop and evaluate
algorithms.  In this paper, we use a different data set, TOEFL11, which
consists of more data (more essays and more languages) and less biased on
prompts, i.e., topics, of essays.  We demonstrate that even using word level
n-gram as features, and support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier can yield
nearly 80% accuracy. We observe that the accuracy of binary based word level
n-gram representation (~80%) is much better than the performance of frequency
based word level n-gram representation (~17%).              In addition, for each
essay
in TOEFL11, the authorâ€™s English proficiency level annotated by assessment
experts is provided.  We also include English proficiency level as a feature
to train our classifier, but adding this feature slightly decreases accuracy.
