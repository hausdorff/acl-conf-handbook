Abstract#==#While working on valency lexicons for Czech and English, it was necessary to
define treatment of multiword entities (MWEs) with the verb as the central
lexical unit. Morphological, syntactic and semantic properties of such MWEs had
to be formally specified in order to create lexicon entries and use them in
treebank annotation. Such a formal specification has also been used for
automated quality control of the annotation vs. the lexicon entries. We present
a corpus-based study, concentrating on multilayer specification of verbal MWEs,
their properties in Czech and English, and a comparison between the two
languages using the parallel Czech-English Dependency Treebank (PCEDT). This
comparison revealed interesting differences in the use of verbal MWEs in
translation (discovering that such MWEs are actually rarely translated as MWEs,
at least between Czech and English) as well as some inconsistencies in their
annotation. Adding MWE-based checks should thus result in better quality
control of future treebank/lexicon annotation. Since Czech and English are
typologically different languages, we believe that our findings will also
contribute to a better understanding of verbal MWEs and possibly their more
unified treatment across languages.
