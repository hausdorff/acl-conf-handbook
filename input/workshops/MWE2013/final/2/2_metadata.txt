Abstract#==#We present an experimental study of how different features help measuring the
idiomaticity of noun+verb (NV) expressions in Basque. After testing several
techniques for quantifying the four basic properties of multiword expressions
or MWEs (institutionalization, semantic non-compositionality, morphosyntactic
fixedness and lexical fixedness), we test different combinations of them for
classification into idioms and collocations, sing Machine Learning (ML) and
feature selection. Key aspects for inflectional and agglutinative languages are
included. The results show the major role of distributional similarity, which
measures compositionality, in the extraction and classification of MWEs,
especially, as expected, in the case of idioms. Even though cooccurrence and
some aspects of morphosyntactic flexibility contribute to this task in a more
limited measure, ML experiments make benefit of these sources of knowledge,
allowing to improve the results obtained using exclusively distributional
similarity features.
