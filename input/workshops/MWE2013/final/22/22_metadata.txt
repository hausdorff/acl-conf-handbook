Abstract#==#A challenging topic of Portuguese language processing is the multifunctional
and ambiguous use of the clitic pronoun 'se', which impacts NLP tasks such as
syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling and machine translation. Aiming to
give a step  forward towards the automatic disambiguation of 'se', our study
focuses on the identification of pronominal verbs, which correspond to one of
the six uses of 'se' as a clitic pronoun, when 'se' is considered a
constitutive particle of the verb lemma to which is bound, as a multiword unit.
Our strategy to  identify such verbs is to analyze the results of a corpus
search to rule out all the other possible uses of 'se'. This process evidenced
the features needed in a computational lexicon to automatically perform the
disambiguation task. The availability of the resulting lexicon of pronominal
verbs on the web enables their inclusion in broader lexical resources, such as
the Portuguese versions of Wordnet, Propbank and VerbNet. Moreover, it will
allow the revision of parsers and dictionaries already in use.
