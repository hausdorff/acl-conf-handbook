Abstract#==#This paper presents an algorithm that allows
the user to issue a query pattern, collects
multi-word expressions (MWEs) that match
the pattern, and then ranks them in a uniform
fashion. This is achieved by quantifying the
strength of all possible relations between the
tokens and their features in the MWEs. The algorithm
collects the frequency of morphological
categories of the given pattern on a unified
scale in order to choose the stable categories
and their values. For every part of speech, and
for all of its categories, we calculate a normalized
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
categoryâ€™s distribution in the pattern and its
distribution in the corpus overall. Categories
with the largest divergence are considered to
be the most significant. The particular values
of the categories are sorted according to
a frequency ratio. As a result, we obtain morphosyntactic
profiles of a given pattern, which
includes the most stable category of the pattern,
and their values.
