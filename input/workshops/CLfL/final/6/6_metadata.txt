Abstract#==#Stylometric analysis of prose is typically limited
to classification tasks such as authorship
attribution. Since the models used are typically
black boxes, they give little insight into
the stylistic differences they detect. In this
paper, we characterize two prose genres syntactically:
chick lit (humorous novels on the
challenges of being a modern-day urban female)
and high literature. First, we develop
a top-down computational method based on
existing literary-linguistic theory. Using an
off-the-shelf parser we obtain syntactic structures
for a Dutch corpus of novels and measure
the distribution of sentence types in chick-lit
and literary novels. The results show that literature
contains more complex (subordinating)
sentences than chick lit. Secondly, a bottom-up
analysis is made of specific morphological and
syntactic features in both genres, based on the
parserâ€™s output. This shows that the two genres
can be distinguished along certain features.
Our results indicate that detailed insight into
stylistic differences can be obtained by combining
computational linguistic analysis with
literary theory.
