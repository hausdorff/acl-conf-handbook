Abstract#==#We propose a method to learn succinct hierarchical linguistic descriptions of
visual datasets, which allow for improved navigation efficiency in image
collections. Classic exploratory data analysis methods, such as agglomerative
hierarchical clustering, only provide a means of obtaining a tree-structured
partitioning of the data. This requires the user to go through the images
first, in order to reveal the semantic relationship between the different
nodes. On the other hand, in this work we propose to learn a hierarchy of
linguistic descriptions, referred to as attributes, which allows for a textual
description of the semantic content that is captured by the hierarchy. Our
approach is based on a generative model, which relates the attribute
descriptions associated with each node, and the node assignments of the data
instances, in a probabilistic fashion. We furthermore use a nonparametric
Bayesian prior, known as the tree-structured stick breaking process, which
allows for the structure of the tree to be learned in an unsupervised fashion.
We also propose appropriate performance measures, and demonstrate superior
performance compared to other hierarchical clustering algorithms.
