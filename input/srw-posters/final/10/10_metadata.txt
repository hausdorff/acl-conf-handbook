Abstract#==#Our research investigates the translation of ontology labels, which has
applications in multilingual knowledge access. Ontologies are often defined
only in one language, mostly English. To enable knowledge access across
languages, such monolingual ontologies need to be translated into other
languages. The primary challenge in ontology label translation is the lack of
context, which makes this task rather different than document translation. The
core objective therefore, is to provide statistical machine translation (SMT)
systems with additional context information. In our approach, we first extend
standard SMT by enhancing a translation model with context information that
keeps track of surrounding words for each translation. We then match these
context words with the ontology vocabulary. The ontology label placement will
now inform an approach that computes a semantic similarity between the phrase
pair context vector from the parallel corpus and a vector of noun phrases that
occur in surrounding ontology labels, i.e. siblings and parents. We applied our
approach to the translation of a financial ontology, translating from English
to German, using Europarl as parallel corpus. This experiment showed that our
approach can provide a slight improvement over standard SMT for this task,
without exploiting any additional domain-specific resources. The core benefit
of the approach is in disambiguation of translations rather than translation
generation.
