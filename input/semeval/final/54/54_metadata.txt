Abstract#==#The fast development of Social Media made it possible for people to no loger
remain mere spectators to the events that happen in the world, 
 but become part of them, commenting on their developments and the entities
involved, 
 sharing their opinions and distributing related content. 
 This phenomenon is of high importance to news monitoring systems, whose aim is
to obtain an informative snapshot of media events and related comments.

 This paper presents the strategies employed in the OPTWIMA participation to
SemEval 2013 Task 2-Sentiment
Analysis in Twitter. The main goal was to evaluate the best settings for a
sentiment analysis component
to be added to the online news monitoring system. 

We describe the approaches used in the competition and the
additional experiments performed combining different datasets for training,
using or not slang replacement and generalizing sentiment-bearing terms by
replacing them with unique labels. The results regarding tweet classification
are promising and show that sentiment generalization can be an effective
approach for tweets and that SMS language is difficult to tackle, even when
specific normalization resources are employed.
