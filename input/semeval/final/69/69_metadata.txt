Abstract#==#In this paper, we present the JUCSE system, designed for the TempEval-3 shared
task. The system extracts events and temporal information from natural text in
English. We have participated in all the tasks of TempEval-3, namely Task A,
Task B & Task C. We have primarily utilized the Conditional Random Field (CRF)
based machine learning technique, for all the above tasks. Our system seems to
perform quite competitively in Task A and Task B. In Task C, the systemâ€™s
performance is comparatively modest at the initial stages of system
development. We have incorporated various features based on different lexical,
syntactic and semantic information, using Stanford CoreNLP and Wordnet based
tools.
