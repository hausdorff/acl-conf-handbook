Abstract#==#We propose a method for using discourse relations for polarity detection of
tweets. We have focused on unstructured and noisy text like tweets on which
linguistic tools like parsers and POS-taggers donâ€™t work properly. We have
showed how conjunctions, connectives, modals and conditionals affect the
sentiments in tweets. We have also handled the commonly used abbreviations,
slangs and  collocations which are usually used in short text messages like
tweets. This work focuses on a Web based application which produces results in
real time. This approach is an extension of the previous work (Mukherjee et al.
2012).
