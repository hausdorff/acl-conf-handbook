Abstract#==#This paper presents a system for automatically generating a set of plausible
paraphrases for a given noun compound and rank them in decreasing order of
their usage represented by the confidence value provided by the human
annotators. Our system implements a corpus-driven probabilistic co-occurrence
based model for predicting the paraphrases, that uses a seed list of
paraphrases extracted from corpus to predict other paraphrases based on their
co-occurrences. The corpus study reveals that the prepositional paraphrases for
the noun compounds are quite frequent and well covered but the verb
paraphrases, on the other hand, are scarce, revealing the unsuitability of the
model for standalone corpus-driven approach. Therefore, to predict other
paraphrases, we adopt a two-fold approach: (i) Prediction based on Verb-Verb
co-occurrences, in case the seed paraphrases are greater than threshold; and
(ii) Prediction based on Semantic Relation of NC, otherwise. The system
achieves a comparable score of 0.23 for the isomorphic system while
maintaining a score of 0.26 for the non-isomorphic system.
