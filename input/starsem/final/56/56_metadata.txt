Abstract#==#This paper deals with knowledge-based text processing which aims at an
intuitive notion of textual similarity. Entities and relations relevant for a
particular domain are identified and disambiguated by means of semi-supervised
machine learning techniques and resulting annotations are applied for computing
typed-similarity of individual texts.

The work described in this paper particularly shows effects of the mentioned
processes in the context of the *SEM 2013 pilot task on typed-similarity, a
part of the Semantic Textual Similarity shared task. The goal is to evaluate
the degree of semantic similarity between semi-structured records. As the
evaluation dataset has been taken from Europeana - a collection of records on
European cultural heritage objects - we focus on computing a semantic distance
on field author which has the highest potential to benefit from the domain
knowledge.

Specific features that are employed in our system BUT-TYPED are briefly
introduced together with a discussion on their efficient acquisition. Support
Vector Regression is then used to combine the features and to provide a final
similarity score. The system ranked third on the attribute author among
15~submitted runs in the typed-similarity task.
