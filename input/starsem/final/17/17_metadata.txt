Abstract#==#Short answer questions for reading comprehension are a common task
  in foreign language learning. Automatic short answer scoring is the
  task of automatically assessing the semantic content of a student's
  answer, marking it e.g. as correct or incorrect. While previous
  approaches mainly focused on comparing a learner answer to some
  reference answer provided by the teacher, we explore the use of the
  underlying reading texts as additional evidence for the
  classification. First, we conduct a corpus study targeting the
  relation between answers and sentences in reading texts for learners
  of German. Second, we use the reading text directly for
  classification, considering three different models: an answer-based
  classifier extended with textual features, a simple text-based
  classifier, and a model that combines the two according to
  confidence of the text-based classification. The most promising
  approach is the first one, results for which show that textual
  features improve classification accuracy. While the other two models
  do not improve classification accuracy, they do investigate the role
  of the text and suggest possibilities for developing automatic
  answer scoring systems with less supervision needed from
  instructors.
