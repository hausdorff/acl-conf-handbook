Abstract#==#We invent referential translation machines (RTMs), a computational model for
identifying the 
translation acts between any two data sets with respect to a reference corpus 
selected in the same domain, 
which can be used for judging the semantic similarity between text.
RTMs make quality and semantic similarity judgments possible by using retrieved

relevant training data as interpretants for reaching shared semantics.
An MTPP (machine translation performance predictor) model derives
features measuring the closeness of the test sentences to the
training data, the difficulty of translating them, 
and the presence of acts of translation involved.
We view semantic similarity as paraphrasing between any two given texts.
Each view is modeled by an RTM model, giving us a new
perspective on the binary relationship between the two.
Our prediction model is the 
$15$th on some tasks and $30$th overall according to the official
results of the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS 2013) challenge.
