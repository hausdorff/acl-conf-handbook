Abstract#==#This tutorial will describe semantic role labeling, the assignment of semantic
roles to eventuality participants in an attempt to approximate a semantic
representation of an utterance. The linguistic background and motivation for
the definition of semantic roles will be presented, as well as the basic
approach to semantic role annotation of large amounts of corpora.  Recent
extensions to this approach that encompass light verb constructions and
predicative adjectives will be included, with reference to their impact on
English, Arabic, Hindi and Chinese. Current proposed extensions such as
Abstract Meaning Representations and richer event representations will also be
touched on.

Details of machine learning approaches will be provided, beginning with fully
supervised approaches that use the annotated corpora as training material.  The
importance of syntactic parse information and the contributions of different
feature choices, including tree kernels, will be discussed, as well as the
advantages and disadvantages of particular machine learning algorithms and
approaches such as joint inference.  Appropriate considerations for evaluation
will be presented as well as successful uses of semantic role labeling in NLP
applications.

We will also cover techniques for exploiting unlabeled corpora and transferring
models across languages. These include methods, which project annotations
across languages using parallel data, induce representations solely from
unlabeled corpora (unsupervised methods) or exploit a combination of a small
amount of human annotation and a large unlabeled corpus (semi-supervised
techniques). We will discuss methods based on different machine learning
paradigms, including generative Bayesian models, graph-based algorithms and
bootstrapping style techniques.
