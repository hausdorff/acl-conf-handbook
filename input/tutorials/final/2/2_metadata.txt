Abstract#==#This tutorial focuses on how morphology, syntax and semantics are introduced in
a standard phrase-based statistical machine translation system by means of
machine learning, parsing and word sense disambiguation, among others.

Machine Translation (MT) is a highly interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary
field since it is  approached from the point of view of human translators,
engineers, computer scientists,  mathematicians and linguists. This tutorial
focuses on describing a standard phrase-based statistical machine translation
(SMT) approach, which is one of the most popular corpus-based MT approaches.
The main challenges of this approach are that the output contains unknown
words, wrong word orders and non-adequate translated words. To solve these
challenges, recent research enhances the standard system using morphology,
syntax and semantics. The main techniques to solve morphology involve
performing morpheme segmentation, enriching input models with morphological
information or adapting language models with morphology knowledge. The
techniques that include syntax use statistical parsing and others. Finally,
semantics are included by using source context information by means of word
sense disambiguation techniques.
