Abstract#==#Traditional relation extraction seeks to identify pre-specified semantic
relations within natural language text, while open Information Extraction (Open
IE) takes a more general approach, and looks for a variety of relations without
restriction to a fixed relation set. With this generalization comes the
question, what is a relation? For example, should the more general task be
restricted to relations mediated by verbs, nouns, or both? To help answer this
question, we propose two levels of subtasks for Open IE. One task determines if
a sentence potentially contains a relation between two entities. The other task
looks to confirm explicit relation words for two entities. We propose multiple
SVM models with dependency tree kernels for both tasks. For explicit relation
extraction, our system can extract both noun and verb relations. Our results on
three datasets show that our system is superior when compared to
state-of-the-art
systems like REVERB and OLLIE for both tasks. For example, in some experiments
our system achieves 33% improvement on nominal relation extraction over OLLIE.
In addition we propose an unsupervised rule-based approach which can serve as a
strong baseline for Open IE systems.
