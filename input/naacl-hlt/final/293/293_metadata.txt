Abstract#==#Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) has a wealth
of natural language processing (NLP) tools
and resources. In comparison, resources for
dialectal Arabic (DA), the unstandardized spoken
varieties of Arabic, are still lacking. We
present ELISSA, a machine translation (MT)
system for DA to MSA. ELISSA employs a
rule-based approach that relies on morphological
analysis, transfer rules and dictionaries
in addition to language models to produce
MSA paraphrases of DA sentences. ELISSA
can be employed as a general preprocessor for
DA when using MSA NLP tools. A manual
error analysis of ELISSAâ€™s output shows
that it produces correct MSA translations over
93% of the time. Using ELISSA to produce
MSA versions of DA sentences as part of
an MSA-pivoting DA-to-English MT solution,
improves BLEU scores on multiple blind test
sets between 0.6% and 1.4%.
