Abstract#==#We introduce a novel algorithm for generating referring expressions, informed
by human and computer vision and designed to refer to visible objects. Our
method separates absolute properties like color from relative properties like
size to stochastically generate a diverse set of outputs. Expressions generated
using this method are often overspecified and may be underspecified, akin to
expressions produced by people. We call such expressions identifying
descriptions. The algorithm out-performs the well-known Incremental Algorithm
(Dale and Reiter, 1995) and the Graph-Based Algorithm (Krahmer et al., 2003;
Viethen et al., 2008) across a variety of images in two domains. We
additionally motivate an evaluation method for referring expression generation
that takes the proposed algorithmâ€™s non-determinism into account.
