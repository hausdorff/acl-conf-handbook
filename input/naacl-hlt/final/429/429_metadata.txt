Abstract#==#Automatically assessing the fidelity of a retelling to the original
  narrative -- a task of growing clinical importance -- is
  challenging, given extensive paraphrasing during retelling along with
cascading
  automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors.  We present a word tagging
  approach using conditional random fields (CRFs) that allows a
  diversity of features to be considered during inference, including some
capturing
  acoustic confusions encoded in word confusion networks.  We evaluate the
  approach under several scenarios, including both supervised and
  unsupervised training, the latter achieved by training on the output
  of a baseline automatic word-alignment model.  We also adapt the ASR
  models to the domain, and evaluate the impact of error rate on
  performance.                                                                       
  We
find
strong
robustness
to ASR
errors, even
using
  just the 1-best system output.  A hybrid approach making use of both
  automatic alignment and CRFs trained tagging models achieves the best
  performance, yielding strong improvements over using either approach
  alone.
