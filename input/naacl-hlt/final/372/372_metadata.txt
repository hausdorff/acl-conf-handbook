Abstract#==#Incorporating semantic structure into a linguistics-free translation model is
challenging, since semantic structures are closely tied to syntax. In this
paper, we propose a two-level approach to exploiting predicate-argument
structure reordering in a hierarchical phrase-based translation model. First,
we introduce linguistically motivated constraints into a hierarchical model,
guiding translation phrase choices in favor of those that respect syntactic
boundaries. Second, based on such translation phrases, we propose a
predicate-argument structure reordering model that predicts reordering not only
between an argument and its predicate, but also between two arguments.
Experiments on Chinese-to-English translation demonstrate that both advances
significantly improve translation accuracy.
