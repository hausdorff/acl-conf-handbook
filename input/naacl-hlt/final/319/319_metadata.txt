Abstract#==#Standard phrase-based translation models do not explicitly model context
dependence between translation units. As a result, they rely on large phrase
pairs and target language models to recover contextual effects in translation.
In this work, we explore n-gram models over Minimal Translation Units (MTUs) to
explicitly capture contextual dependencies across phrase boundaries in the
channel model. As there is no single best direction in which contextual
information should flow, we explore multiple decomposition structures as well
as  dynamic bidirectional decomposition. The resulting models are evaluated in
an intrinsic task of lexical selection for MT as well as a full MT system,
through n-best reranking. These experiments demonstrate that additional
contextual modeling does indeed benefit a phrase-based system and that the
direction of conditioning is important. Integrating multiple conditioning
orders provides consistent benefit, and the most important directions differ by
language pair.
