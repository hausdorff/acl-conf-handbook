This paper describes a dual-classifier approach to contextual sentiment analysis at the SemEval-2013 Task 2. Contextual analysis of polarity focuses on
 a word or phrase, rather than the broader task of identifying the sentiment of
 an entire text. The Task 2 definition includes target word spans that range in
 size from a single word to entire sentences. However, the context of a single
 word is dependent on the word's surrounding syntax, while a phrase contains
 most of the polarity within itself. We thus describe separate treatment with
 two independent classifiers, outperforming the accuracy of a single classifier.
 Our system ranked 6th out of 19 teams on SMS message classification, and 8th of
 23 on twitter data. We also show a surprising result that a very small amount
 of word context is needed for high-performance polarity extraction.
