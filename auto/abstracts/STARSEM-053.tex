This paper describes the specifications and results of UMCC\_DLSI system, which participated in the Semantic Textual Similarity task (STS) of SemEval-2013. Our
 supervised system uses different types of lexical and semantic features to
 train a Bagging classifier used to decide the correct option. Related to the
 different features we can highlight the resource ISR-WN used to extract
 semantic relations among words and the use of different algorithms to establish
 semantic and lexical similarities. In order to establish which features are the
 most appropriate to improve STS results we participated with three runs using
 different set of features. Our best run reached the position 44 in the official
 ranking, obtaining a general correlation coefficient of 0.61.
