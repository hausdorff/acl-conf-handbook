We discuss a tagging scheme to tag data for training information extraction models which can extract the features of a product/service and opinions about
 them from textual reviews, and which can be used across different domains with
 minimal adaptation. A simple tagging scheme results in a large number of domain
 dependent opinion phrases and impedes the usefulness of the trained models
 across domains. We show that by using minor modifications to this simple
 tagging scheme the number of domain dependent opinion phrases are reduced from
 36\% to 17\%, which leads to models more useful across domains.
