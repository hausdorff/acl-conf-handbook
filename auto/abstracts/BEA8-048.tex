Native Language Identification (NLI), which tries to identify the native language (L1) of a second language learner based on their writing, is helpful
 for advancing second language learning and authorship profiling in forensic
 linguistics. With the availability of relevant data resources, much work has
 been done to explore the effective way to identify the native language of a
 foreign language learner. In this report, we present our system for the first
 shared task in Native Language Identification (NLI). We use a linear SVM
 classifier and explore features of word and character n-grams. Our official
 system achieves accuracy of 0.773, which ranks it 18th among the 29 teams in
 the closed track.
