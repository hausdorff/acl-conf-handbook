This paper describes the usage of Natural Language Processing tools,   mostly probabilistic topic modeling, to study semantics (word
   correlations) in a collection of Persian poems consisting of roughly
   18k poems from 30 different poets.  For this study, we put a lot of
   effort in the preprocessing and the development of a large scope
   lexicon supporting both modern and ancient Persian. In the analysis
   step, we obtained very interesting and meaningful results regarding
   the correlation between poets and topics, their evolution through
   time, as well as the correlation between the topics and the metre
   used in the poems. This work should thus provide valuable results to
   literature researchers, especially for those working on
   stylistics or comparative literature.
