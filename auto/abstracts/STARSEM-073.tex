This article provides a detailed overview of the CPN text-to-text similarity system that we participated with in the Semantic Textual Similarity task
 evaluations hosted at *Sem 2013. In addition to more traditional components,
 such as knowledge-based and corpus-based metrics leveraged in a machine
 learning framework, we also use opinion analysis features to achieve a stronger
 semantic representation of textual units. While the evaluation datasets are not
 designed to test the similarity of opinions, as a component of textual
 similarity, nonetheless, our system variations ranked number 38, 39 and 45
 among the 88 participating systems.
