In this paper we introduce our contribution to the SemEval-2013 Task 2 on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. We participated in task B, where the objective
 was to build models which classify tweets into three classes (positive,
 negative or neutral) by their contents. To solve this problem we basically
 followed the supervised learning approach and proposed several domain
 (i.e.~microblog) specific improvements including text preprocessing and feature
 engineering. Beyond the supervised setting we also introduce some early results
 employing a huge, automatically annotated tweet dataset.
