The goal of the Cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task is to evaluate the viability of multilingual WSD on a benchmark lexical sample data set. The
 traditional WSD task is transformed into a multilingual WSD task, where
 participants are asked to provide contextually correct translations of English
 ambiguous nouns into five target languages, viz. French, Italian, English,
 German and Dutch. We report results for the 12 official submissions from 5
 different research teams, as well as for the ParaSense system that was
 developed by the task organizers.
