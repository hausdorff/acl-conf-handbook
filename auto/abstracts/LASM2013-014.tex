We perform a series of 3-class sentiment classification experiments on a set of 2,624 tweets produced during the run-up to the Irish General Elections in
 February 2011. Even though tweets that have been labelled as sarcastic
 have been omitted from this set, it still represents a difficult test set and
 the highest accuracy we achieve is 61.6\% using supervised learning and a
 feature set consisting of subjectivity-lexicon-based scores, Twitter-specific
 features and the top 1,000 most discriminative words. This is superior to
 various naive unsupervised approaches which use subjectivity lexicons to
 compute an overall sentiment score for a <tweet,political party> pair.
