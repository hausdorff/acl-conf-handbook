Many NLP applications require information about locations of objects referenced in text,
 or relations between them in space. For example,
 the phrase a book on the desk contains
 information about the location of the object
 book, as trajector, with respect to another object
 desk, as landmark. Spatial Role Labeling
 (SpRL) is an evaluation task in the information
 extraction domain which sets a goal
 to automatically process text and identify objects
 of spatial scenes and relations between
 them. This paper describes the task in Semantic
 Evaluations 2013, annotation schema,
 corpora, participants, methods and results obtained
 by the participants.
