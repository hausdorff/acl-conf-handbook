The widespread use of Twitter makes it very interesting to determine the opinions and the sentiments expressed by its users. The shortness of the length
 and the highly informal nature of tweets render it very difficult to
 automatically detect such information. This paper reports the results to a
 challenge, set forth by SemEval-2013 Task 2,  to determine the positive,
 neutral, or negative sentiments of tweets. Two systems are explained:  System A
 for determining the sentiment of an interval within a tweet and System B for
 determining the sentiment of a tweet. Both approaches rely on rich feature
 sets, which are explained in detail.
