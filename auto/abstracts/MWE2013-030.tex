Practitioners of English Natural Language Processing often feel fortunate because their tokens are clearly marked by spaces on either side. However, the
 spaces can be quite deceptive, since they ignore the boundaries of multi-word
 expressions, such as noun-noun compounds, verb particle constructions, light
 verb constructions and constructions from Construction Grammar, e.g.,
 caused-motion constructions and resultatives. Correctly identifying and
 handling these types of expressions can be quite challenging, even from the
 viewpoint of manual annotation. This talk will review the pervasive nature of
 these constructions, touching on Arabic and Hindi as well as English. Using
 several illustrative examples from newswire and medical informatics, current
 best practices for annotation and automatic identification will be described,
 with an emphasis on contributions from predicate argument structures.
