In a meeting, it is often desirable to extract keywords from each utterance as soon as it is spoken. Thus, this paper proposes a just-in-time keyword
 extraction from meeting transcripts. The proposed method considers two major
 factors that make it different from keyword extraction from normal texts. The
 first factor is the temporal history of preceding utterances that grants higher
 importance to recent utterances than old ones, and the second is
 topic-relevance that forces only the preceding utterances relevant to the
 current utterance to be considered in keyword extraction. Our experiments on
 two data sets in English and Korean show that the consideration of the factors
 results in performance improvement in keyword extraction from meeting
 transcripts.
