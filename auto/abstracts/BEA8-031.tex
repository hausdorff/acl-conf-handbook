This paper reports our contribution to the 2013 NLI Shared Task. The purpose of the task was to train a machine-learning system to identify the native-language
 affiliations of 1,100 texts written in English by nonnative speakers as part of
 a high-stakes test of gen- eral academic English proficiency. We trained our
 system on the new TOEFL11 corpus, which includes 11,000 essays written by
 nonnative speakers from 11 native-language backgrounds. Our final system used
 an SVM classifier with over 400,000 unique features consisting of lexical and
 POS n-grams occur- ring in at least two texts in the training set. Our system
 identified the correct native- language affiliations of 83.6\% of the texts in
 the test set. This was the highest classification accuracy achieved in the 2013
 NLI Shared Task.
