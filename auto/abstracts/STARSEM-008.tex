The development of compositional distributional models of semantics reconciling the empirical aspects of distributional semantics with the compositional
 aspects of formal semantics is a popular topic in the contemporary literature.
 This paper seeks to bring this reconciliation one step further, by showing how
 the mathematical constructs commonly used in compositional distributional
 models, such as tensors and matrices, can be used to simulate different aspects
 of predicate logic. 
 
   This paper discusses how the canonical isomorphism between tensors and
 multilinear maps can be exploited to simulate a full-blown quantifier free
 predicate calculus using tensors. It provides tensor interpretations of the set
 of logical connectives required to model propositional calculi. It suggests a
 variant of these tensor calculi capable of modelling quantifiers, using few
 non-linear operations. It finally discusses the relation between these
 variants, and how this relation should constitute the subject of future work.
