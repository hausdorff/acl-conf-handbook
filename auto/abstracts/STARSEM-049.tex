The Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task aims to exam the degree of semantic equivalence between sentences (Agirre et al., 2012). This paper presents the
 work of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyUCOMP) team which has
 participated in the STS core and typed tasks of SemEval-2013. For the STS core
 task, the PolyUCOMP system disambiguates words senses using contexts and then
 determine sentence similarity by counting the number of senses they shared. For
 the STS typed task, the string kernel (Lodhi et al., 2002) is used to compute
 similarity between two entities to avoid string variations in entities.
