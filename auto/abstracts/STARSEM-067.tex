This paper describes our system entered for the *SEM 2013 shared task on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS).  We focus on the core task of predicting
 the semantic textual similarity of sentence pairs.
 
 The current system utilizes machine learning techniques trained on semantic
 similarity ratings from the *SEM 2012 shared task; it achieved rank 20
 out of 90 submissions from 35 different teams.                                Given
 the
 simple
 nature
 of 
 our approach, which uses only WordNet and unannotated corpus data as external
 resources, we consider this a remarkably good result, making the system 
 an interesting tool for a wide range of practical applications.
