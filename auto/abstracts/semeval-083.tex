In this paper we present our system for the SemEval 2013 Task 5a on semantic similarity of words and compositional phrases. Our system uses a
 dependency-based vector space model, in combination with a technique called
 latent vector weighting. The system computes the similarity between a
 particular noun instance and the head noun of a particular noun phrase, which
 was weighted according to the semantics of the modifier. The system is entirely
 unsupervised; one single parameter, the similarity threshold, was tuned using
 the training data.
