We report on the performance of two different feature sets in the Native Language Identification Shared Task (Tetreault et al., 2013). Our feature sets
 were inspired by existing literature on native language identification and word
 networks. Experiments show that word networks have competitive performance
 against the baseline feature set, which is a promising result. We also present
 a discussion of feature analysis based on information gain, and an overview on
 the performance of different word network features in the Native Language
 Identification task.
