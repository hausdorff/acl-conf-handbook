This paper describes the system implemented by Fundaci√≥ Barcelona Media (FBM) for classifying the polarity of opinion expressions in tweets and SMSs, and
 which is supported by a UIMA pipeline for rich linguistic and sentiment
 annotations.  
   FBM participated in the SEMEVAL 2013 Task 2 on polarity classification. It
 ranked 5th in Task A (constrained track) using an ensemble system combining ML
 algorithms with dictionary-based heuristics, and 7th (Task B, constrained)
 using an SVM classifier with features derived from the linguistic annotations
 and some heuristics.
