The measurement of phrasal semantic relatedness is an important metric for many natural language processing applications. In this paper, we present three
 approaches for measuring phrasal semantics, one based on a semantic network
 model, another on a distributional similarity model, and a hybrid between the
 two. Our hybrid approach achieved an F-measure of 77.4\\% on the task of
 evaluating the semantic similarity of words and compositional phrases.
