In this paper, we describe our system that participated in SemEval-2013, Task 2.B (sentiment analysis in Twitter). Our approach consists of adapting Naive
 Bayes probabilities in order to take into account prior knowledge (represented
 in the form of a sentiment lexicon). We propose two different methods to
 efficiently incorporate prior knowledge. We show that our approach outperforms
 the classical Naive Bayes method and shows competitive results with SVM while
 having less computational complexity.
