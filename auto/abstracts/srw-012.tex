Entrainment is the phenomenon of conversational partners becoming more similar to each other as they speak. This thesis proposal presents a comprehensive look
 at entrainment in human conversations and how entrainment may be incorporated
 into the design of spoken dialogue systems in order to improve system
 performance and user satisfaction. We compare different kinds of entrainment in
 both classic and novel dimensions, provide experimental results on the utility
 of entrainment, and show that entrainment can be used to improve a system's ASR
 performance and turn-taking decisions.
