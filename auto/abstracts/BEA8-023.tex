Focusing on applications for analyzing leaner language which evaluate semantic appropriateness and accuracy, we collect data from a task which models some
 aspects of interaction, namely a picture description task (PDT).  We parse
 responses to the PDT into dependency graphs with an an off-the-shelf parser,
 then use a decision tree to classify sentences into syntactic types and extract
 the logical subject, verb, and object, finding 92\\% accuracy in such
 extraction. The specific goal in this paper is to examine the challenges
 involved in extracting these simple semantic representations from interactive
 learner sentences.
