Native Language Identification, or NLI, is the task of automatically classifying
 the L1 of a writer based solely on his or her essay written in another
 language.  This problem area has
 seen a spike in interest in recent years as it can have an impact on
 educational applications tailored towards non-native speakers of a language,
 as well as authorship profiling.
 While there has been a growing body of work in NLI, it has been difficult to
 compare
 methodologies because of the different approaches to pre-processing the data,
 different
 sets of languages identified, and different splits of the data used.
 In this shared task, the first
 ever for Native Language Identification, we sought to
 address the above issues by providing a large corpus designed specifically for
 NLI,
 in addition to providing an environment for systems to be directly compared.
 In this paper, we report the results of the shared task.
 A total of 29 teams from around the world competed across
 three different sub-tasks.
