The topic of sentiment analysis in text has been extensively studied in English for the past 30 years. An early, influential work by Cynthia Whissell, the
 Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL), allows rating words along three
 dimensions: pleasantness, activation and imagery. Given the lack of such tools
 in Spanish, we decided to replicate Whissell's work in that language. This
 paper describes the Spanish DAL, a knowledge base formed by more than 2500
 words manually rated by humans along the same three dimensions. We evaluated
 its usefulness on two sentiment analysis tasks, which showed that the knowledge
 base managed to capture relevant information regarding the three affective
 dimensions.
