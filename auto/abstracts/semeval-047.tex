This work introduces a new unsupervised approach to multilingual word sense disambiguation. Its main purpose is to automatically choose the intended sense
 (meaning) of a word in a particular context for different languages. It does so
 by selecting the correct Babel synset for the word and the various Wiki Page
 titles that mention the word. BabelNet contains all the output information that
 our system needs, in its Babel synset. Through Babel synset, we find all the
 possible Synsets for the word in WordNet. Using these Synsets, we apply the
 disambiguation method Ppr+Freq to find what we need. To facilitate the work
 with WordNet, we use the ISR-WN which offers the integration of different
 resources to WordNet. Our system, recognized as the best in the competition,
 obtains results around 69\% of Recall.
