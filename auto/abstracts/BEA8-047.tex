We decribe the submissions made by the National Research Council   Canada to the Native Language Identification (NLI) shared task.  Our
   submissions rely on a Support Vector Machine classifier, various
   feature spaces using a variety of lexical, spelling, and syntactic
   features, and on a simple model combination strategy relying on a
   majority vote between classifiers.  Somewhat surprisingly, a
   classifier relying on purely lexical features performed very well
   and proved difficult to outperform significantly using various
   combinations of feature spaces. However, the combination of multiple
   predictors allowed to exploit their different strengths and provided
   a significant boost in performance.
