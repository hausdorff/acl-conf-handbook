This paper discusses preliminary work investigating the application of Machine Translation (MT) metrics toward the evaluation of translations written by human
 novice (student) translators.  We describe a study in which we apply the metric
 TERp (Translation Edit Rate Plus) to a corpus of student-written translations
 from Spanish to English and compare the judgments of TERp against assessments
 provided by a translation instructor.
