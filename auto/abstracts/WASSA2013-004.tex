This paper describes a novel approach for sexual predator detection in chat conversations based on sequences of classifiers. The proposed approach divides
 documents into three parts, which, we hypothesize, correspond to the different
 stages that a predator employs when approaching a child. Local classifiers are
 trained for each part of the documents and their outputs are combined by a
 chain  strategy: predictions of a local classifier are used as extra inputs for
 the next local classifier. Additionally, we propose a ring-based strategy, in
 which the chaining process is iterated several times, with the goal of further
 improving the performance of our method.  We report experimental results on the
 corpus used in the first international competition on sexual predator
 identification (PAN'12). Experimental results show that the proposed method
 outperforms a standard (global) classification technique for the different
 settings we consider; besides the proposed method compares favorably with most
 methods evaluated in the PAN'12 competition.
