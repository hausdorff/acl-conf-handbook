In this paper we present the results of experiments comparing (a) rich syntactic and semantic feature sets and (b) big context windows, for the
 TempEval time expression and event segmentation and classification tasks.  We
 show that with large windows of context, it is possible for models using only
 lexical features to approach the performance of models using rich syntactic and
 semantic feature sets.
