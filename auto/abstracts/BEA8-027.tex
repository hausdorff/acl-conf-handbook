This paper presents a Native Language Identification (NLI) system based on TF-IDF weighting schemes and using linear classifiers - support vector
 machines, logistic regressions and perceptrons. The system was one of the
 participants of the 2013 NLI Shared Task  in the closed-training track,
 achieving 0.814 overall accuracy for a set of 11 native languages. This
 accuracy was only 2.2 percentage points lower than the winner's performance.
 Furthermore, with subsequent evaluations using 10-fold cross-validation (as
 given by the organizers) on the combined training and development data, the
 best average accuracy obtained is 0.8455 and the features that contributed to
 this accuracy are the TF-IDF of the combined unigrams and bigrams of words.
