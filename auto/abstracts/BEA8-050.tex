This paper describes MITRE's participation in the native language identification (NLI) task at BEA-8. Our best effort performed at an accuracy of
 82.6\% in the eleven-way NLI task, placing it in a statistical tie with the best
 performing systems. We describe the variety of machine learning approaches that
 we explored, including Winnow, language modeling, logistic regression and
 maximum-entropy models. Our primary features were word and character n-grams.
 We also describe several ensemble methods that we employed for combining these
 base systems.
