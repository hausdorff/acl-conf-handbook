The ClearTK-TimeML submission to TempEval 2013 competed in all English tasks: identifying events, identifying times, and identifying temporal relations. The
 system is a pipeline of machine-learning models, each with a small set of
 features from a simple morpho-syntactic annotation pipeline, and where temporal
 relations are only predicted for a small set of syntactic constructions and
 relation types. ClearTK-TimeML ranked 1st for temporal relation F1, time extent
 strict F1 and event tense accuracy.
