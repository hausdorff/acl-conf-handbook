Graph based dependency parsing is inefficient when handling non-local features due to high computational complexity of inference. In this paper, we proposed
 an exact and efficient decoding algorithm based on the Branch and Bound (B\&B)
 framework where non-local features are bounded by a linear combination of local
 features. Dynamic programming is used to search the upper bound. Experiments
 are conducted on English PTB and Chinese CTB datasets. We achieved competitive
 Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) when no additional resources are available:
 93.17\% for English and 87.25\% for Chinese. Parsing speed is 177 words per
 second for English and 97 words per second for Chinese. Our algorithm is
 general and can be adapted to non-projective dependency parsing or other
 graphical models.
