A drug-drug interaction (DDI) occurs when one drug affects the level or activity of another drug. Semeval 2013 DDI Extraction challenge is going to be
 held with the aim of identifying the state of the art relation extraction
 algorithms.
 In this paper we firstly review some of the existing approaches in relation
 extraction generally and biomedical relations especially. And secondly we will
 explain our SVM based approaches that use lexical, morphosyntactic and parse
 tree features. Our combination of sequence and tree kernels have shown
 promising performance with a best result of 0.54 F1 macroaverage on the test
 dataset.
