In this paper, we define the SemEval-2013 Task9: Extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions from Biomedical Texts (DDIExtraction 2013). We describe how the
 data sets were created. Also, we report and analyze the results and describe
 the participant systems.
 The DDIExtraction 2013 task concerns the recognition of drugs and extraction of
 drug-drug interactions that appear in biomedical literature. 
 We propose two subtasks for the DDIExtraction 2013 Shared Task challenge: 1)
 the recognition and classification of drug names and 2) the extraction and
 classification of their interactions.
 Both subtasks have been very successful in participation
 and results. There were 14 teams who submitted a total of 38 runs.
 The best result reported for the first subtask was F1 of 71.5\\% and 65.1\\% for
 the second one.
