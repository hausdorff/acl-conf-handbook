We present our entries for the SemEval-2013 cross-language word-sense disambiguation task. We submitted three systems based on
 classifiers trained on local context features, with some elaborations. Our
 three systems, in increasing order of complexity, were: maximum entropy
 classifiers trained to predict the desired target-language phrase using only
 monolingual features (we called this system L1); similar classifiers,
 but with the desired target-language phrase for the other four languages as
 features (L2); and lastly, networks of five classifiers, over which we
 do loopy belief propagation to solve the classification tasks jointly
 (MRF).
