This paper describes our system for shared task 13 ``Word Sense Induction for Graded and Non-Graded Senses'' of SemEval-2013. The task
 is on word sense induction (WSI), and builds on earlier SemEval WSI
 tasks in exploring the possibility of multiple senses being compatible
 to varying degrees with a single contextual instance: participants are
 asked to \textit{grade} senses rather than selecting a single sense
 like most word sense disambiguation (WSD) settings. The evaluation
 measures are designed to assess how well a system perceives the
 different senses in a contextual instance. We adopt a
 previously-proposed WSI methodology for the task, which is based on a
 Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), a non-parametric topic model.
 Our system requires no parameter tuning, uses the English ukWaC as an
 external resource, and achieves encouraging results over the shared
 task.
