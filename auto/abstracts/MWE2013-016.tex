This paper presents our ongoing project for construction of an English MWE dictionary, and its application to MWE-aware POS tagging.
 The experimental results show that the MWE-aware tagger achieved
 better performance on POS tagging and MWE recognition. Currently we only deal
 with fixed MWEs, including adverbs, conjunctions, determiners, prepositions,
 prepositional phrases and pronouns.
