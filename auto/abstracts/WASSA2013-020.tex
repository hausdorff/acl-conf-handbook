We compare the performance of two lexicon-based sentiment systems -   SentiStrength (Thelwall et al. 12) and SO-CAL
   (Taboada et al. 11} on the two genres of newspaper text and
   tweets. While SentiStrength has been geared specifically toward
   short social-media text, SO-CAL was built for general, longer
   text. After the initial comparison, we successively enrich the
   SO-CAL-based analysis with tweet-specific mechanisms and observe
   that in some cases, this improves the performance. A qualitative
   error analysis then identifies classes of typical problems the two
   systems have with tweets.
