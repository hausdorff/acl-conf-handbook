This paper describes LIMSI's participation to the first shared task on Native Language Identification. Our submission uses a Maximum Entropy
 classifier, using as features character and chunk n-grams, spelling
 and grammatical mistakes, and lexical preferences. Performance was
 slightly improved by using a two-step classifier to better distinguish
 otherwise easily confused native languages.
