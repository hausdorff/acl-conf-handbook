We present a computational notion of Lexical Tightness that measures global cohesion of content
 words in a text. Lexical tightness represents
 the degree to which a text tends to use words
 that are highly inter-associated in the language.
 We demonstrate the utility of this measure for
 estimating text complexity as measured by US
 school grade level designations of texts. Lexical
 tightness strongly correlates with grade level in
 a collection of expertly rated reading materials.
 Lexical tightness captures aspects of prose
 complexity that are not covered by classic readability
 indexes, especially for literary texts. We
 also present initial findings on the utility of this
 measure for automated estimation of complexity
 for poetry.
