This paper reports on a study of inter-annotator agreement (IAA) for a dependency annotation scheme designed for learner English. Reliably annotated
 learner corpora are a necessary step for the development of POS tagging and
 parsing of learner language. In our study, three  annotators marked
 several layers of annotation over different levels of learner texts, and they
 are able to obtain generally high agreement, especially after discussing the
 disagreements among themselves, without researcher intervention, illustrating
 the feasibility of the scheme. We pinpoint some of the problems in obtaining
 full agreement, including annotation scheme vagueness for certain learner
 innovations, interface design issues, and difficult syntactic constructions. In
 the process, we also develop ways to calculate agreements for sets of
 dependencies.
