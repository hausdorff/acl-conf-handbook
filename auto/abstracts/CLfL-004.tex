There are cultural barriers to collaborative effort between literary scholars and computational linguists. In this work, we discuss some of these problems in
 the context of our ongoing research project, an exploration of free indirect
 discourse in Virginia Woolf's To The Lighthouse, ultimately arguing that the
 advantages of taking each field out of its ``comfort zone'' justifies the
 inherent
 difficulties.
