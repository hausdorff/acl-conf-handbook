We present two systems developed at the University of Ottawa for the SemEval 2013 Task 2. The first system (for Task A) classifies the polarity / sentiment
 orientation of one target word in a Twitter message. The second system (for
 Task B) classifies the polarity of whole Twitter messages. Our two systems are
 very simple, based on supervised classifiers with bag-of-words feature
 representation, enriched with information from several sources. We present a
 few additional results, besides results of the submitted runs.
