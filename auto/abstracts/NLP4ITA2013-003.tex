The purpose of this paper is to motivate and describe a system that simplifies numerical expression in texts, along with an evaluation study in which experts
 in numeracy and literacy assessed the outputs of this system. We have worked
 with a collection of newspaper articles with a significant number of numerical
 expressions. The results are discussed in comparison to conclusions obtained
 from a prior empirical survey.
