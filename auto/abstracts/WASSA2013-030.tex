In this paper we focus on the detection of deceptive opinion spam, which consists
 of fictitious opinions that have been deliberately
 written to sound authentic, in order
 to deceive the consumers. In particular we
 propose a method based on the PU-Learning
 approach which learns only from a few positive
 examples and a set of unlabeled data.
