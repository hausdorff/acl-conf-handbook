This paper describes the system that was submitted in the *SEM 2013 Semantic Textual Similarity shared task. The task aims to find the similarity score
 between a pair of sentences.  We describe a Universal Networking Language (UNL)
 based semantic extraction system for measuring the semantic similarity. Our
 approach combines syntactic and word level similarity measures along with the
 UNL based semantic similarity measures for finding similarity scores between
 sentences.
