Up until now most of the methods published for polarity classification are applied to English texts. However, other languages on the Internet are becoming

 Spanish product reviews. Using a comparable corpus, a supervised method and two
 unsupervised methods have been assessed. Furthermore, a list of Spanish opinion
 words is presented as a valuable resource.
