This paper describes the evaluation of different kinds of textual features for the Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment Task of SemEval 2013. We have counted the
 number of N-grams for three types of textual entities (character, word and PoS
 tags) that exist in the pair of sentences from which we are interested in
 determining the judgment of textual entailment. Difference, intersection and
 distance (Euclidian, Manhattan and Jaccard) of N-grams were considered for
 constructing a feature vector which is further introduced in a support vector
 machine classifier which allows to construct a classification model. Five
 different runs were submitted, one of them considering

 median of six teams that have participated in the competition.
