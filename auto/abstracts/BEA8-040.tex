We explore a range of features and ensembles for the task of Native Language Identification as part of the NLI Shared Task (Tetreault et al., 2013).
 Starting with recurring word-based n-grams (Bykh and Meurers, 2012), we tested
 different linguistic abstractions such as part-of-speech, dependencies, and
 syntactic trees as features for NLI. We also experimented with features
 encoding morphological properties, the nature of the realizations of particular
 lemmas, and several measures of complexity developed for proficiency and
 readability classification (Vajjala and Meurers, 2012). Employing an ensemble
 classifier incorporating all of our features we achieved an accuracy of 82.2\%
 (rank 5) in the closed task and 83.5\% (rank 1) in the open-2 task. In the
 open-1 task, the word-based recurring n-grams outperformed the ensemble,
 yielding 38.5\% (rank 2). Overall, across all three tasks, our best accuracy of
 83.5\% for the standard TOEFL11 test set came in second place.
