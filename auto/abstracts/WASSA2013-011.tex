Sentiment analysis means to extract opinion of users from review documents. Sentiment classification using Machine Learning (ML) methods faces the problem
 of high dimensionality of feature vector. Therefore, a feature selection method
 is required to eliminate the irrelevant and noisy features from the feature
 vector for efficient working of ML algorithms. Rough Set Theory based feature
 selection method finds the optimal feature subset by eliminating the redundant
 features. In this paper, Rough Set Theory (RST) based feature selection method
 is applied for sentiment classification. A Hybrid feature selection method
 based on RST and Information Gain (IG) is proposed for sentiment
 classification. Proposed methods are evaluated on four standard datasets viz.
 Movie review, product (book, DVD and electronics) review dataset. Experimental
 results show that Hybrid feature selection method outperforms than other
 feature selection methods for sentiment classification.
