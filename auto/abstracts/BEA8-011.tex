We present a method for automatically detecting missing hyphens in English text. Our method goes beyond a purely dictionary-based approach and also takes
 context into account. We evaluate our model on artificially generated data as
 well as naturally occurring learner text. Our best-performing models achieve
 high precision and reasonable recall, making it suitable for inclusion in a
 system that gives feedback to language learners.
