In this paper we describe our system used to participate in the Student-Response-Analysis task-7 at SemEval 2013. This system is based on text
 overlap through the soft cardinality and a new mechanism for weight
 propagation. Although there are several official performance measures, taking
 into account the overall accuracy throughout the two availabe data sets (Beetle
 and SciEntsBank), our system ranked first in the 2 way classification task and
 second in the others. Furthermore, our system performs particularly well with
 ``unseen-domains'' instances, which was the more challenging test set. This
 paper also describes another system that integrates this method with the
 lexical-overlap baseline provided by the task organizers obtaining better
 results than the best official results. We concluded that the soft cardinality
 method is a very competitive baseline for the automatic evaluation of student
 responses.
