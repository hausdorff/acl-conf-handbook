We present a system for automatically identifying the native language of a writer. We experiment with a large set of features and train them on a corpus
 of 9,900 essays written in English by speakers of 11 different languages. our
 system achieved an accuracy of 43\\% on the test data, improved to 63\\% with
 improved feature normalization. In this paper, we present the features used in
 our system, describe our experiments and provide an analysis of our results.
