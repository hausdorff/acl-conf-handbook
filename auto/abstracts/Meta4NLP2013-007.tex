Metaphor is a pervasive feature of human language that enables us to conceptualize and communicate abstract concepts using more concrete
 terminology. Unfortunately, it is also a feature that serves to confound a
 computer's ability to comprehend natural human language. We present a method
 to detect linguistic metaphors by inducing a domain-aware semantic signature
 for a given text and comparing this signature against a large index of known
 metaphors. By training a suite of binary classifiers using the results of
 several semantic signature-based rankings of the index, we are able to detect
 linguistic metaphors in unstructured text at a significantly higher precision
 as compared to several baseline approaches.
