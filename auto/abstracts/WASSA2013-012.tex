In this work, we attempt to detect sentence-level subjectivity by means of two supervised machine learning approaches: a Fuzzy Control System and Adaptive
 Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System. Even though these methods are popular in pattern
 recognition, they have not been thoroughly investigated for subjectivity
 analysis. We present a novel ``Pruned ICF Weighting Coefficient,'' which
 improves the accuracy for subjectivity detection. Our feature extraction
 algorithm calculates a feature vector based on the statistical occurrences of
 words in a corpus without any lexical knowledge. For this reason, these machine
 learning models can be applied to any language; i.e., there is no lexical,
 grammatical, syntactical analysis used in the classification process.
