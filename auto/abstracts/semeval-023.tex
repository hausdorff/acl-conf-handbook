This paper describes our approach to the SemEval-2013 task on ``Sentiment Analysis in Twitter''. We use simple bag-of-words models, a freely available
 sentiment dictionary automatically extended with distributionally similar
 terms, as well as lists of emoticons and internet slang abbreviations in
 conjunction with fast and robust machine learning algorithms. The resulting
 system is resource-lean, making it relatively independent of a specific
 language. Despite its simplicity, the system achieves competitive accuracies of
 0.70--0.72 in detecting the sentiment of text messages. We also apply our
 approach to the task of detecting the context-dependent sentiment of individual
 words and phrases within a message.
