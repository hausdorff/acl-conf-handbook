While the automatic translation of tweets has already been investigated in different scenarios, we are not aware of any attempt to translate tweets
 created by government agencies. In this study, we report the experimental
 results we obtained when translating 12 Twitter feeds published by agencies and
 organizations of the government of Canada, using a state-of-the-art Statistical
 Machine Translation (SMT) engine as a black box translation device. We mine
 parallel web pages linked from the URLs contained in English-French pairs of
 tweets in order to create tuning and training material. For a Twitter feed that
 would have been otherwise difficult to translate, we report significant gains
 in translation quality using this strategy. Furthermore, we give a detailed
 account of the problems we still face, such as hashtag translation as well as
 the generation of tweets of legal length.
