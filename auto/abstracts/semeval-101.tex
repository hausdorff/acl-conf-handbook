In recent years, sentiment analysis in social media has attracted a lot of research interest
 and has been used for a number of applications.
 Unfortunately, research has been hindered
 by the lack of suitable datasets, complicating
 the comparison between approaches.
 To address this issue, we have proposed
 SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in
 Twitter, which included two subtasks: A, an
 expression-level subtask, and B, a message-level
 subtask. We used crowdsourcing on
 Amazon Mechanical Turk to label a large
 Twitter training dataset along with additional
 test sets of Twitter and SMS messages for both
 subtasks. All datasets used in the evaluation
 are released to the research community. The
 task attracted significant interest and a total
 of 149 submissions from 44 teams. The best-performing
 team achieved an F1 of 88.9\\% and
 69\\% for subtasks A and B, respectively.
