We describe three semantic text similarity systems developed for the *SEM 2013 STS shared task and the results of the corresponding three runs. All of them
 shared a word similarity feature that combined LSA word similarity and WordNet
 knowledge. The first, which achieved the best mean score of the 89 submitted
 runs, used a simple term alignment algorithm augmented with penalty
 terms. The other two runs, ranked second and fourth, used support vector
 regression models to combine larger sets of features.
