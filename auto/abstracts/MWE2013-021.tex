The paper describes a method for identifying and translating multiword expressions using a bi-directional dictionary. While a dictionary-based
 approach suffers from limited recall, precision is high; hence it is best
 employed alongside an approach with complementing properties, such as an n-gram
 language model.
 
 We evaluate the method on data from the English-German translation part of the
 cross-lingual word sense disambiguation task in the 2010 semantic evaluation
 exercise (SemEval). The output of a baseline disambiguation system based on
 n-grams was substantially improved by matching the target words and their
 immediate contexts against compound and collocational words in a dictionary.
