Within the SemEval-2013 evaluation exercise, the TempEval-3 shared task aims to advance research on temporal information processing. It follows on from
 TempEval-1 and -2, with: a three-part structure covering  temporal expression,
 event, and temporal relation extraction; a larger dataset; and new single
 measures to rank systems -- in each task and in general. In this paper, we
 describe the participants' approaches, results, and the observations from the
 results, which may guide future research in this area.
