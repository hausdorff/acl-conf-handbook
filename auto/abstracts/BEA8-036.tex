Our goal is to predict the first language (L1) of English essays's authors with the help of TOEFL11 corpus where L1, prompts (topics) and proficiency levels
 are provided. Thus we approach this task as a classification task employing
 machine learning methods.  Out of key concepts of machine learning, we focus on
 feature engineering. We design features across all the L1 languages not making
 use of knowledge of prompt and proficiency level. During system development, we
 experimented with various techniques for feature filtering and combination
 optimized with respect to the notion of mutual information and information
 gain. We trained four different SVM models and combined them through majority
 voting achieving accuracy 72.5\%.
