T.S. Eliot's modernist poem The Waste Land is often interpreted as collection of voices which appear multiple times throughout the text. Here, we investigate
 whether we can automatically cluster existing segmentations of the text into
 coherent, expert-identified characters. We show that clustering The Waste Land
 is a fairly difficult task, though we can do much better than random baselines,
 particularly if we begin with a good initial segmentation.
