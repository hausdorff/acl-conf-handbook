In this paper the UNITOR-HMM-TK system participating to the Spatial Role Labeling task at SemEval 2013 is presented. The spatial roles classification is
 addressed as a sequence-based word classification problem: the SVMhmm learning
 algorithm is applied, based on a simple feature modeling and a robust lexical
 generalization achieved through a Distributional Model of Lexical Semantics. In
 the identification of spatial relations, roles are combined to generate
 candidate relations, later verified by a SVM classifier. The Smoothed Partial
 Tree Kernel is here applied, i.e. a convolution kernel that enhances both
 syntactic and lexical properties of the examples, avoiding the need of a manual
 feature engineering phase. Finally, results on three of the five tasks of the
 challenge are reported.
