This paper describes the systems submitted by Avaya Labs (AVAYA) to SemEval-2013 Task 2 - Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.  For the constrained
 conditions of both the message polarity classification and contextual polarity
 disambiguation subtasks, our approach centers on training high-dimensional,
 linear classifiers with a combination of lexical and syntactic features.  The
 constrained message polarity model is then used to tag nearly half a million
 unlabeled tweets.  These automatically labeled data are used for two purposes:
 1) to discover prior polarities of words and 2) to provide additional training
 examples for self-training.  Our systems performed competitively, placing in
 the top five for all subtasks and data conditions.  More importantly, these
 results show that expanding the polarity lexicon and augmenting the training
 data with unlabeled tweets can yield improvements in precision and recall in
 classifying the polarity of non-neutral messages and contexts.
