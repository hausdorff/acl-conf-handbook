Deciding whether a synchronous grammar formalism generates a given word alignment
 (the alignment coverage problem) depends on
 finding an adequate instance grammar and
 then using it to ``parse'' the word alignment.
 But what does it mean to parse a word alignment
 by a synchronous grammar? This is formally
 undefined until we define an unambiguous
 mapping between grammatical derivations
 and word-level alignments. This paper
 proposes an initial, formal characterization
 of alignment coverage as intersecting two
 partially ordered sets (graphs) of translation
 equivalence units, one derived by a grammar
 instance and another defined by the word
 alignment. As a first application, we report extensive
 coverage results for ITG on automatic
 and manual alignments. Even for the ITG formalism,
 our formal characterization makes explicit
 many of the algorithmic choices often left underspecified
 in earlier work.
