This paper describes our system for Task 11 of SemEval-2013. In the task, participants are provided with a set of ambiguous search queries
 and the snippets returned by a search engine, and are asked to
 associate senses with the snippets.  The snippets are then clustered
 using the sense assignments and systems are evaluated based on the
 quality of the snippet clusters. Our system adopts a pre-existing Word
 Sense Induction (WSI) methodology based on Hierarchical Dirichlet
 Process (HDP), a non-parametric topic model.  Our system is trained
 over extracts from the full text of English Wikipedia, and is shown to
 perform well in the shared task.
