This work performs some basic research upon topical poetry segmentation in a pilot study designed to test some initial assumptions and methodologies. Nine
 segmentations of the poem titled Kubla Khan (Coleridge, 1816, pp. 55-58) are
 collected and analysed, producing low but comparable inter-coder agreement.
 Analyses and discussions of these codings focus upon how to improve agreement
 and outline some initial results on the nature of topics in this poem.
