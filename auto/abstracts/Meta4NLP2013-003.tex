This article discusses metaphor annotation in a corpus of argumentative essays written by test-takers during a standardized examination for graduate school
 admission. The quality of argumentation being the focus of the project, we
 developed a metaphor annotation protocol that targets metaphors that are
 relevant for the writer's arguments. The reliability of the protocol is
 kappa=0.58, on a set of 116 essays (the total of about 30K content-word
 tokens). We found a moderate-to-strong correlation (r=0.51-0.57) between the
 percentage of metaphorically used words in an essay and the writing quality
 score. We also describe encouraging findings regarding the potential of 
 metaphor identification to contribute to automated scoring of essays.
