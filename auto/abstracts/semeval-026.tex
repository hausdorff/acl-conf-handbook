This paper briefly reports our submissions to the two subtasks of Semantic Analysis in Twitter task in SemEval 2013 (Task 2), i.e., the Contextual
 Polarity Disambiguation task (an expression-level task) and the Message
 Polarity Classification task (a message-level task). We extract features from
 surface information of tweets, i.e., content features, Micro-blogging features,
 emoticons, punctuation and sentiment lexicon, and adopt SVM to build
 classifier. For subtask A, our system on twitter data ranks 2 on unconstrained
 rank and on SMS data ranks 1 on unconstrained rank.
