This paper describes a complete event/time ordering system that annotates raw text with events, times, and the ordering relations between them at the
 SemEval-2013 Task 1. Task 1 is a unique challenge because it starts from raw
 text, rather than pre-annotated text with known events and times. A working
 system first identifies events and times, then identifies which events and
 times should be ordered, and finally labels the ordering relation between them.
 We present a split classifier approach that breaks the ordering tasks into
 smaller decision points. Experiments show that more specialized classifiers
 perform better than few joint classifiers. The NavyTime system ranked second
 both overall and in most subtasks like event extraction and relation labeling.
