This paper describes the system developed for the NLI~2013 Shared Task, requiring to identify writer's native language by some text written in English.
 I explore the given manually annotated data using word features such as the
 length, endings and character trigrams. Furthermore, I employ k-NN 
 classification. The modified TFIDF is used to generate stop-word list
 automatically. The distance between two documents is calculated combining
 n-grams of word lengths and endings, and character trigrams.
