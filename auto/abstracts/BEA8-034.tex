In this paper, we describe our approach to native language identification and discuss the results we submitted as participants to the First NLI Shared Task.
 By resorting to a wide set of general---purpose features qualifying the lexical
 and grammatical structure of a text, rather than to ad hoc features
 specifically selected for the NLI task, we achieved encouraging results, which
 show that the proposed approach is general---purpose and portable across
 different tasks, domains and languages.
