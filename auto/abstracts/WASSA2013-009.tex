In this paper we propose a method that uses corpora where phrases are annotated as Positive, Negative, Objective and Neutral, to achieve new sentiment
 resources involving words dictionaries with their associated polarity. Our
 method was created to build sentiment words inventories based on senti-semantic
 evidences obtained after exploring text with annotated sentiment polarity
 information. Through this process a graph-based algorithm is used to obtain
 auto-balanced values that characterize sentiment polarities well used on
 Sentiment Analysis tasks. To assessment effectiveness of the obtained resource,
 sentiment classification was made, achieving objective instances over 80\%.
