This paper presents UoS, a graph-based Word Sense Induction system which attempts to find all applicable senses of a target word given its context,
 grading each sense according to its suitability to the context. Senses of a
 target word are induced through use of a non-parameterised, linear-time
 clustering algorithm that returns maximal quasi-strongly connected components
 of a target word graph
 in which vertex pairs are assigned to the same cluster if either vertex has the
 highest edge weight to the other. UoS participated in SemEval-2013 Task 13:
 Word Sense Induction for Graded and Non-Graded Senses. Two system were
 submitted; both systems returned results comparable with those of the best
 performing systems.
