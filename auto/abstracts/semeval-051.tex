This paper describes University of Leipzig's approach to SemEval-2013 task 2B on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter: message polarity classification. Our system
 is designed to function as a baseline, to see what we can accomplish with
 well-understood and purely data-driven lexical features, simple generalizations
 as well as standard machine learning techniques: We use one-against-one Support
 Vector Machines with asymmetric cost factors and linear ``kernels'' as
 classifiers, word uni- and bigrams as features and additionally model negation
 of word uni- and bigrams in word $n$-gram feature space. We consider
 generalizations of URLs, user names, hash tags, repeated characters and
 expressions of laughter. Our method ranks 23 out of all 48 participating
 systems, achieving an averaged (positive, negative) F-Score of 0.5456 and an
 averaged (positive, negative, neutral) F-Score of 0.595, which is above median
 and average.
