Document-level sentiment analysis can benefit from fine-grained   subjectivity, so that sentiment polarity judgments are based on the
   relevant parts of the document. While fine-grained subjectivity
   annotations are rarely available, encouraging results have been
   obtained by modeling subjectivity as a latent variable. However,
   latent variable models fail to capitalize on our linguistic
   knowledge about discourse structure. We present a new method for
   injecting linguistic knowledge into latent variable subjectivity
   modeling, using discourse connectors. Connector-augmented
     transition features allow the latent variable model to learn the
   relevance of discourse connectors for subjectivity transitions,
   without subjectivity annotations.  This yields significantly
   improved performance on document-level sentiment analysis in English
   and Spanish. We also describe a simple heuristic for automatically
   identifying connectors when no predefined list is available.
