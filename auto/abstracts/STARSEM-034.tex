Wikipedia articles are annotated by volunteer contributors with numerous links that connect words and phrases to relevant titles. Links to general senses of a
 word are used concurrently with links to more specific senses, without being
 distinguished explicitly. We present an approach to training coarse to fine
 grained sense disambiguation systems in the presence of such annotation
 inconsistencies. Experimental results show that accounting for annotation
 ambiguity in Wikipedia links leads to significant improvements in
 disambiguation.
