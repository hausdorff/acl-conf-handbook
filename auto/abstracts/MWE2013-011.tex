This paper presents an algorithm that allows the user to issue a query pattern, collects
 multi-word expressions (MWEs) that match
 the pattern, and then ranks them in a uniform
 fashion. This is achieved by quantifying the
 strength of all possible relations between the
 tokens and their features in the MWEs. The algorithm
 collects the frequency of morphological
 categories of the given pattern on a unified
 scale in order to choose the stable categories
 and their values. For every part of speech, and
 for all of its categories, we calculate a normalized
 Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
 category's distribution in the pattern and its
 distribution in the corpus overall. Categories
 with the largest divergence are considered to
 be the most significant. The particular values
 of the categories are sorted according to
 a frequency ratio. As a result, we obtain morphosyntactic
 profiles of a given pattern, which
 includes the most stable category of the pattern,
 and their values.
