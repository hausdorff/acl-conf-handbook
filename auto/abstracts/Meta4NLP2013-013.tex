We aim to investigate cross-cultural patterns of thought through cross-linguistic investigation of the use of metaphor. As a first step, we
 produce a system for locating instances of metaphor in English and Spanish
 text. In contrast to previous work which relies on re-sources like syntactic
 parsing and WordNet, our system is based on LDA topic modeling, enabling its
 application even to low-resource languages. We achieve an F-score of 59\% for
 English.
