This paper presents our approach to the 2013 Native Language Identification shared task, which is based on machine learning methods that work at the
 character level. More precisely, we used several string kernels and a kernel
 based on Local Rank Distance (LRD). Actually, our best system was a kernel
 combination of string kernel and LRD. While string kernels have been used
 before in text analysis tasks, LRD is a distance measure designed to work on
 DNA sequences. In this work, LRD is applied with success in native language
 identification.
 
 Finally, the Unibuc team ranked third in the closed NLI Shared Task. This
 result is more impressive if we consider that our approach is language
 independent and linguistic theory neutral.
