Though much research has been conducted on Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis (SSA)during the last decade, little work has focused on Arabic. In this work,
 we focus on SSA for both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) news articles and
 dialectic Arabic microblogs from Twitter. We showcase some of the challenges
 that are associated with SSA on microblogs. We adopted a random graph walk
 approach to extend the Arabic SSA lexicon using Arabic-English phrase tables,
 leading to improvements for SSA on Arabic microblogs. We used different
 features for both subjectivity and sentiment classification including stems,
 part-of-speech tags, as well as tweet specific features. Our classification
 features yield results that surpass results in the literature.
