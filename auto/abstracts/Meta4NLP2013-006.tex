A metaphor is a figure of speech that refers to one concept in terms of another, as in ``He is such a sweet person''. Metaphors are ubiquitous and
 present NLP with a range of challenges for WSD, IE, etc. Identifying metaphors
 is thus an important step in language understanding. However, almost any word
 can serve as a metaphor, which makes them impossible to list. We assume that
 metaphorical use of a word results in unusual semantic patterns with its
 dependencies. Bootstrapping from available metaphor lists, we create a balanced
 corpus of 3872 instances that we release to the public. We use it to train a
 SVM with tree-kernels to classify metaphorical use. This outperforms an
 informed base- line, sequential and vector-based approaches, and achieves an
 F1-score of 0.75.
