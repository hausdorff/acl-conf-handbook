I present a set of functional requirements for a speculative tool informing users about events in historical discourse, in order to demonstrate what these
 requirements imply about how we should define and represent historical events.
 The functions include individuation, selection, and contextualization of
 events. I conclude that a tool providing these functions would need events to
 be defined and represented as features of discourses about the world rather
 than objectively existing things in the world.
