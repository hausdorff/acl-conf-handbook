We investigate the task of detecting reliable statements about food-health relationships from natural language texts.
 For that purpose, we created a specially annotated web corpus from forum
 entries discussing the healthiness of certain food items.
 We examine a set of task-specific high-level features that are instrumental in
 finding utterances that are commonly perceived as reliable.
 These features are incorporated in a supervised classifier and compared against
 standard features.
