This study explores the efficacy of an approach to native language identification that utilizes grammatical, rhetorical, semantic, syntactic, and
 cohesive function categories comprised of key ngrams. The study found that a
 model based on these categories of key ngrams was able to successfully predict
 the L1 of essays written in English by L2 learners from 11 different L1
 backgrounds with an accuracy of 59\%. Preliminary findings concerning instances
 of crosslinguistic influence are discussed, along with evidence of language
 similarities based on patterns of language misclassification.
