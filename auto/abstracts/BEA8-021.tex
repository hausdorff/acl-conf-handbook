We describe the NUS Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE), a large,   fully annotated corpus of learner English that is freely available
   for research purposes. The goal of the corpus is to provide a large
   data resource for the development and evaluation of grammatical
   error correction systems. Although NUCLE has been available for
   almost two years, there has been no reference paper that describes
   the corpus in detail. In this paper, we address this need. We
   describe the annotation schema and the data collection and
   annotation process of NUCLE. Most importantly, we report on an
   unpublished study of annotator agreement for grammatical error
   correction. Finally, we present statistics on the distribution of
   grammatical errors in the NUCLE corpus.
