In this paper we present our systems for calculating the degree of semantic similarity between two texts that we submitted to the Semantic Textual
 Similarity task at SemEval-2013. Our systems predict similarity using a
 regression over features based on the following sources of information: 
 string similarity, topic distributions of the texts based on latent Dirichlet 
 allocation, and similarity between the documents returned by an information 
 retrieval engine when the target texts are used as queries. We also explore
 methods for integrating predictions using different training
 datasets and feature sets. Our best system was ranked 17th out of 89 
 participating systems. In our post-task analysis, we identify simple changes to
 our system that further improve our results.
