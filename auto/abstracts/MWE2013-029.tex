The issue of flexibility of multiword expressions (MWEs) is crucial towards their identification and extraction in running text, as well as their better
 understanding from a linguistic perspective. If we project a large MWE lexicon
 onto a corpus, projecting fixed forms suffers from low recall, while an
 unconstrained flexible search for lemmas yields a loss in precision. In this
 talk, I will describe a method aimed at maximising precision in the
 identification of MWEs in flexible mode, building on the idea that internal
 variability can be modelled via so-called variation patterns. I will discuss
 the advantages and limitations of using variation patterns, compare their
 performance to that of association measures, and explore their usability in MWE
 extraction, too.
