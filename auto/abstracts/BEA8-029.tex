Our submission for this NLI shared task used for the most part standard features found in recent work. Our focus was instead on two other aspects of
 our system: at a high level, on possible ways of constructing ensembles of
 multiple classifiers; and at a low level, on the granularity of part-of-speech
 tags used as features. We found that the choice of ensemble combination
 method did not lead to much difference in results, although exploiting the
 varying behaviours of linear versus logistic regression SVM classifiers could
 be promising in future work; but part-of-speech tagsets showed noticeable
 differences.
 
 We also note that the overall architecture, with its feature set and ensemble
 approach, had an accuracy of 83.1\% on the test set when trained on both the
 training data and development data supplied, close to the best result of the
 task. This suggests that basically throwing together all the features of
 previous work will achieve roughly the state of the art.
