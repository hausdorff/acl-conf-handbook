This paper describes methods that were submitted as part of the *SEM shared task on Semantic Textual Similarity. 
 
 Multiple kernels provide different views of syntactic structure, from both tree
 and dependency parses. The kernels are then combined with simple lexical
 features using Gaussian process regression, which is trained on different
 subsets of training data for each run. We found that the simplest combination
 has the highest consistency across the different data sets, while introduction
 of more training data and models requires training and test data with matching
 qualities.
