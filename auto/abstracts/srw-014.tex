Review mining and summarization has been a hot topic for the past decade. A lot of effort has been devoted to aspect detection and sentiment analysis under the
 assumption that every review has the same utility for related tasks. However,
 reviews are not equally helpful as indicated by user-provided helpfulness
 assessment associated with the reviews. In this thesis, we propose a novel
 review summarization framework which summarizes review content under the
 supervision of automated assessment of review helpfulness. This
 helpfulness-guided framework can be easily adapted to traditional review
 summarization tasks, for a wide range of domains.
