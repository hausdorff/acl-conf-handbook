Persons affected by Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) present impairments in social
 interaction. A significant percentile of
 them have inadequate reading comprehension
 skills. In the ongoing FIRST project we build
 a multilingual tool called Open Book that
 helps the ASD people to better understand the
 texts. The tool applies a series of automatic
 transformations to user documents to identify
 and remove the reading obstacles to comprehension.
 We focus on three semantic components:
 an Image component that retrieves images
 for the concepts in the text, an idiom detection
 component and a topic model component.
 Moreover, we present the personalization
 component that adapts the system output
 to user preferences.
