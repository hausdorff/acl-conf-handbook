This paper describes the system submitted by the MELODI team for the SemEval-2013 Task 4: Free Paraphrases of Noun Compounds. Our approach combines
 the strength of an unsupervised distributional word space model with a
 supervised maximum-entropy classification model; the distributional model
 yields a feature representation for a particular compound noun, which is
 subsequently used by the classifier to induce a number of appropriate
 paraphrases.
