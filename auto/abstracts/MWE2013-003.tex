This paper describes our approach to managing multiword expressions in Sentitext, a linguistically-motivated, lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis (SA)
 system for Spanish whose performance is largely determined by its coverage of
 MWEs. We defend the view that multi-word constructions play a fundamental role
 in lexical Sentiment Analysis, in at least three ways. First, a significant
 proportion conveys semantic orientation; second, being units of meaning, their
 relative weight to the calculated overall sentiment rating of texts needs to be
 accounted for as such, rather than the number of component lexical units; and,
 third, many MWEs contain individual words that carry a given polarity, which
 may or may not be that of the phrase as a whole. As a result, successful
 lexicon-based SA calls for appropriate management of MWEs.
