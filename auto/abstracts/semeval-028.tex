This paper presents the multi-phase relation extraction (RE) approach which was used for the DDI Extraction task of SemEval 2013. As a preliminary step, the
 proposed approach indirectly (and automatically) exploits the scope of negation
 cues and the semantic roles of involved entities for reducing the skewness in
 the training data as well as discarding possible negative instances from the
 test data. Then, a state-of-the-art hybrid kernel is used to train a classifier
 which is later applied on the instances of the test data not filtered out by
 the previous step. The official results of the task show that our approach
 yields an F-score of 0.80 for DDI detection and an F-score of 0.65 for DDI
 detection and classification. Our system obtained significantly higher results
 than all the other participating teams in this shared task and has been ranked
 1st.
