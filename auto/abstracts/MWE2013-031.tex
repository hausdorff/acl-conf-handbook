Multiword expressions as they appear as nominal compounds, collocational forms, and idioms are now leveraged in educational technology in assessment and
 instruction contexts. The talk will focus on how multiword expression
 identification is used in different kinds of educational applications,
 including automated essay evaluation, and teacher professional development in
 curriculum development for English language learners. Recent approaches
 developed to resolve polarity for noun-noun compounds in a sentiment system
 being designed to handle evaluation of argumentation (sentiment) in test-taker
 writing (Beigman-Klebanov, Burstein, and Madnani, to appear) will also be
 described.
