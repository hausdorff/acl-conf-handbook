This paper describes the details of our system submitted to the SemEval-2013 shared task on sentiment analysis in Twitter. Our approach to predicting the
 sentiment of Tweets and SMS is based on supervised machine learning techniques
 and task-specific feature engineering. We used a linear classifier trained by
 stochastic gradient descent with hinge loss and elastic net regularization to
 make our predictions, which were ranked first or second in three of the four
 experimental conditions of the shared task. Furthermore, our system makes use
 of social media specific text preprocessing and linguistically motivated
 features, such as word stems, word clusters and negation handling.
