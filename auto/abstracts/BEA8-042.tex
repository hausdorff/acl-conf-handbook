We apply Support Vector Machines to differentiate between 11 native languages in the
 2012 Native Language Identification Shared
 Task. We expand a set of common language
 identification features to include cognate interference
 and spelling mistakes. Our best results
 are obtained with a classifier which includes
 both the cognate and the misspelling features,
 as well as word unigrams, word bigrams, character
 bigrams, and syntax production rules.
