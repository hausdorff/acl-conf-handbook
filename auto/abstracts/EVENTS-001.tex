In this paper we present ongoing work for the creation of a linguistically-based system for event coreference. We assume that this task
 requires deep understanding of text and that statistically-based methods, both
 supervised and unsupervised are inadequate. The reason for this choice is due
 to the fact that event coreference can only take place whenever argumenthood is
 properly computed. It is a fact that in many cases, arguments of predicates are
 implicit and thus linguistically unexpressed. This prevents training to produce
 sensible results. We also assume that spatiotemporal locations need to be taken
 into account and this is also very often left implicit. We used GETARUNS system
 to develop the coreference system which works on the basis of the discourse
 model and the automatically annotated markables. We present data from the
 analysis, both on unexpressed implicit arguments and the description of the
 coreference algorithm.
