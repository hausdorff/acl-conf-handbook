This paper describes the system developed by the Serendio team for the SemEval-2013 Task 2 competition (Task A). We use a lexicon based approach for
 discovering sentiments. Our lexicon is built from the  Serendio taxonomy. The
 Serendio taxonomy consists of positive, negative, negation, stop words and
 phrases. A typical tweet contains word variations, emoticons, hashtags etc. We
 use preprocessing steps such as stemming, emoticon detection and normalization,
 exaggerated word shortening and hashtag detection. After the preprocessing, the
 lexicon-based system classifies the tweets as positive or negative based on the
 contextual sentiment orientation of the words. Our system yields an F-score of
 0.8004 on the test dataset.
