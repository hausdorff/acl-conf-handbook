This paper explores two hypotheses regarding vector space models that predict the compositionality of German noun-noun compounds: (1) Against our intuition,
 we demonstrate that window-based rather than syntax-based distributional
 features perform better predictions, and that not adjectives or verbs but nouns
 represent the most salient part-of-speech. Our overall best result is
 state-of-the-art, reaching Spearman's rho=0.65 with a word-space model of
 nominal features from a 20-word window of a 1.5 billion word web corpus. (2)
 While there are no significant differences in predicting compound--modifier vs.
 compound--head ratings on compositionality, we show that the modifier (rather
 than the head) properties predominantly influence the degree of
 compositionality of the compound.
