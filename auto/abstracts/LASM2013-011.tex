In this paper, we describe a novel approach to automatically detecting and tracking discussion dynamics in Internet social media by focusing on attitude
 modeling of topics. We characterize each participant's attitude to-wards
 topics as Topical Positioning, employ Topical Positioning Map to represent the
 positions of participants with respect to each other and track attitude shifts
 over time. We also discuss how we used participants' attitudes towards
 system-detected meso-topics to reflect their attitudes towards the overall
 topic of conversation. Our approach can work across different types of social
 media, such as Twitter discussion and online chat room. In this article, we
 show results on Twitter data.
