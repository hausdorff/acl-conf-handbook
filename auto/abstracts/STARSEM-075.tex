This paper presents three methods to evaluate the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS). The first two methods do not require labeled training data; instead,
 they automatically extract semantic knowledge in the form of word associations
 from a given reference corpus. Two kinds of word associations are considered:
 cooccurrence statistics and the similarity of word contexts. The third method
 was done in collaboration with LIPN and UMCC\_DLSI. It uses several word
 similarity measures as features in order to construct an accurate prediction
 model for the STS.
