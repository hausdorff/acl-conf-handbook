This paper describes an effort to perform Na- tive Language Identification (NLI) using ma- chine learning on a large amount of lexical features. The
 features were collected from se- quences and collocations of bare word forms,
 suffixes and character n-grams amounting to a feature set of several hundred
 thousand fea- tures. These features were used to train a lin- ear Support
 Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for predicting the native language category.
