This paper describes the IIRG system entered in SemEval-2013, the 7th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation. We participated in Task 5
 Evaluating Phrasal Semantics. We have adopted a token-based approach to solve
 this task using 1) Naıve Bayes methods and 2) Word Overlap methods, both of
 which rely on the extraction of syntactic features. We found that the word
 overlap method significantly out performs the Naıve Bayes methods, achieving
 our highest overall score with an accuracy of approximately 78\%.
