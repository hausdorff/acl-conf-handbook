This paper present the contribution of our team at task 2 of SemEval 2013 : Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. We submited a constrained run for each of the
 two  subtasks. In the Contextual Polarity Disambiguation subtask, we use a
 sentiment lexicon approach combined with polarity shift detection and tree
 kernel based classifiers. In Message Polarity Classification subtask, we focus
 on the influence of domain information on sentiment classification.
