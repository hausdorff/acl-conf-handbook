We describe TWITA, the first corpus of Italian tweets, which is created via a completely automatic procedure, portable to any other language.
 We experiment with sentiment analysis on two datasets from TWITA: a
 randomly selected collection and a topic-specific collection. The only resource
 we use is a polarity lexicon, which we obtain by automatically matching three
 existing resources thereby creating the first polarity database for Italian. We
 observe that albeit shallow, our simple system captures polarity distinctions
 matching reasonably well the classification of tweets done by human judges,
 with differences in performance across polarity values and on the two sets.
