In this paper, we describe our system submitted for the Sentiment Analysis task at SemEval 2013 (Task 2). A combination of Explicit Semantic
 Analysis (ESA)with Naive Bayes classifier was implemented. ESA represents text
 as a high dimensional vector of explicitly defined topics, following the
 distributional semantic model. This approach is novel in the sense that ESA has
 not been used for Sentiment Analysis in the literature, to the best of our
 knowledge.
