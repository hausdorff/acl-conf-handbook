In this paper we describe our system submitted for evaluation in the CLTE-SemEval-2013 task, which achieved the best results in two of the four data
 sets, and finished third in average. This system consists of a SVM classifier
 with features extracted from texts (and their translations SMT) based on a
 cardinality function. Such function was the soft cardinality. Furthermore, this
 system was simplified by providing a single model for the 4 pairs of languages
 obtaining better (unofficial) results than separate models for each language
 pair. We also evaluated the use of additional circular-pivoting translations
 achieving results 6.14\% above the best official results.
