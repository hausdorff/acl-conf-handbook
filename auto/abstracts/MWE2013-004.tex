The linguistic annotation of noun-verb complex predicates (also known as light verb constructions) is a challenging task as they are highly productive in
 Hindi. For the task of semantic role
 labelling, each argument of the noun-verb complex predicate must be given a
 role label. The PropBank approach to semantic role labelling defines the set of
 semantic roles for a given predicate in a â€˜frame file'. The creation of
 frame files is usually done manually, but we explore an automatic method to
 expedite this process. We use two resources for this method: Hindi PropBank
 frame files for simple verbs and the annotated Hindi Treebank. Our method
 perfectly predicts 65\% of the roles in 3015 unique noun-verb combinations, with
 an additional 22\% partial predictions, giving us 87\% useful predictions
 to build our annotation resource.
