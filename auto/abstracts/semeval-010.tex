This paper presents our approach used for cross-lingual textual entailment task (task 8) organized within SemEval 2013. Cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE)
 tries to detect the entailment relationship between two text fragments in
 different languages. We solved this problem in three steps. Firstly, we use a
 off-the-shelf machine translation (MT) tool to convert the two input texts into
 the same language. Then after performing a text preprocessing, we extract
 multiple feature types with respect to surface text and grammar. We also
 propose novel feature types regarding to sentence difference and semantic
 similarity based on our observations in the preliminary experiments. Finally,
 we adopt a multiclass SVM algorithm for classification. The results on the
 cross-lingual data collections provided by SemEval 2013 show that (1) we can
 build portable and effective systems across languages using MT and multiple
 effective features; (2) our systems achieve the best results among the
 participants on two test datasets, i.e., FRA-ENG and DEU-ENG.
