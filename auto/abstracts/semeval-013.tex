We describe the LIMSI system for the SemEval-2013 Cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation (CLWSD) task. Word senses are represented by means of
 translation clusters in different languages built by a cross-lingual Word Sense
 Induction (WSI) method. Our CLWSD classifier exploits the WSI output for
 selecting appropriate translations for target words in context. We present the
 design of the system and the obtained results.
