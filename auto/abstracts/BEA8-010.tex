We investigate the utility of linguistic features for automatically differentiating between children with varying combinations of two potentially
 comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders: autism spectrum disorder and specific
 language impairment. We find that certain manual codes for linguistic errors
 are useful for distinguishing between diagnostic groups. We investigate the
 relationship between coding detail and diagnostic classification performance,
 and find that a simple coding scheme is of high diagnostic utility. We propose
 a simple method to automate the pared down coding scheme, and find that these
 automatic codes are of diagnostic utility.
