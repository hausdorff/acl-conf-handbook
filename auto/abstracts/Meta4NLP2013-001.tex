The paper presents an experimental algorithm to detect conventionalized metaphors implicit in the lexical data in a resource like WordNet, where
 metaphors are coded into the senses and so would never be detected by any
 algorithm based on the violation of preferences, since there would always be a
 constraint satisfied by such senses. We report an implementation of this
 algorithm, which was implemented first the preference constraints in VerbNet.
 We then derived in a systematic way a far more extensive set of constraints
 based on WordNet glosses, and with this data we reimplemented the detec- tion
 algorithm and got a substantial improvement in recall. We suggest that this
 technique could contribute to improve the performance of existing metaphor
 detec- tion strategies that do not attempt to detect convention- alized
 metaphors. The new WordNet-derived data is of wider significance because it
 also contains adjective constraints, unlike any existing lexical resource, and
 can be applied to any language with a semantic parser (and WN) for it.
