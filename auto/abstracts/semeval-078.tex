In this paper, we describe the UKP Lab system participating in the Semeval-2013 task ``Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation within an End-User
 Application''. Our approach uses preprocessing, co-occurrence ex traction,
 graph clustering, and a state-of-the- art word sense disambiguation system. We
 developed a configurable pipeline which can be used to integrate and evaluate
 other components for the various steps of this task.
