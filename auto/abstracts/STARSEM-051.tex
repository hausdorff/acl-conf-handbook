This paper describes a system for automatically measuring the semantic similarity between two texts, which was the aim of the 2013 Semantic Textual
 Similarity (STS) task (Agirre et al., 2013). For the 2012 STS task, Heilman and
 Madnani (2012) submitted the PERP system, which performed competitively in
 relation to other submissions. However, approaches including word and n-gram
 features also performed well (Baer et al., 2012; Saric et al., 2012), and the
 2013 STS task focused more on predicting similarity for text pairs from new
 domains. Therefore, for the three variations of our system that we were allowed
 to submit, we used stacking (Wolpert, 1992) to combine PERP with word and
 n-gram features and applied the domain adaptation approach outlined by Daume
 III (2007) to facilitate generalization to new domains. Our submissions
 performed well at most subtasks, particularly at measuring the similarity of
 news headlines, where one of our submissions ranked 2nd among 90 from 36 teams,
 but there is still room for improvement.
