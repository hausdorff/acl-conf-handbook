This paper introduces PersPred, the first manually elaborated syntactic and semantic database for Persian Complex Predicates (CPs). Beside their
 theoretical interest, Persian CPs constitute an important challenge in Persian
 lexicography and for NLP. The first delivery, PersPred 1, contains 700 CPs, for
 which 22 fields of lexical, syntactic and semantic information are encoded. The
 semantic classification it provides allows to account for the productivity of
 these combinations in a way which does justice to their compositionality
 without overlooking their idiomaticity.
