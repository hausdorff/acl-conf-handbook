This paper describes the NRC submission to the Spanish Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation task at SemEval-2013.  Since this word sense disambiguation task
 uses Spanish translations of English words as gold annotation, it can be cast
 as a machine translation problem. We therefore submitted the output of a
 standard phrase-based system as a baseline, and investigated ways to improve
 its sense disambiguation performance.  Using only local context information and
 no linguistic analysis beyond lemmatization, our machine translation system
 surprisingly yields top precision score based on the best predictions. However,
 its top 5 predictions are weaker than those from other systems.
