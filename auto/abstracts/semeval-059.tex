We present a supervised sentiment detection system that classifies the polarity of subjec- tive phrases as positive, negative, or neutral. It is tailored
 towards online genres, specifically Twitter, through the inclusion of
 dictionaries developed to capture vocabulary used in on- line conversations
 (e.g., slang and emoticons) as well as stylistic features common to social
 media. We show how to incorporate these new features within a state of the art
 system and evaluate it on Task A in SemEval-2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in
 Twitter.
