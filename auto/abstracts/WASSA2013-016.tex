We present a bootstrapping algorithm to automatically learn hashtags that convey emotion.
 Using the bootstrapping framework, we
 learn lists of emotion hashtags from unlabeled
 tweets. Our approach starts with a small number
 of seed hashtags for each emotion, which
 we use to automatically label tweets as initial
 training data. We then train emotion classifiers
 and use them to identify and score candidate
 emotion hashtags. We select the hashtags
 with the highest scores, use them to automatically
 harvest new tweets from Twitter, and
 repeat the bootstrapping process. We show
 that the learned hashtag lists help to improve
 emotion classification performance compared
 to an N-gram classifier, obtaining 8\% micro-average
 and 9\% macro-average improvements
 in F-measure.
