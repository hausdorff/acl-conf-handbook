This paper presents a system for automatically generating a set of plausible paraphrases for a given noun compound and rank them in decreasing order of
 their usage represented by the confidence value provided by the human
 annotators. Our system implements a corpus-driven probabilistic co-occurrence
 based model for predicting the paraphrases, that uses a seed list of
 paraphrases extracted from corpus to predict other paraphrases based on their
 co-occurrences. The corpus study reveals that the prepositional paraphrases for
 the noun compounds are quite frequent and well covered but the verb
 paraphrases, on the other hand, are scarce, revealing the unsuitability of the
 model for standalone corpus-driven approach. Therefore, to predict other
 paraphrases, we adopt a two-fold approach: (i) Prediction based on Verb-Verb
 co-occurrences, in case the seed paraphrases are greater than threshold; and
 (ii) Prediction based on Semantic Relation of NC, otherwise. The system
 achieves a comparable score of 0.23 for the isomorphic system while
 maintaining a score of 0.26 for the non-isomorphic system.
