Our system combines text similarity measures with a textual entailment system. In the main task, we focused on the influence of lexicalized versus
 unlexicalized features, and how they affect performance on unseen questions and
 domains. We also participated in the pilot partial entailment task, where our
 system significantly outperforms a strong baseline.
