In Italian, the class of superlativizing structures alternative to the morphological superlative is very rich and consists, among others, of adverbs
 of degree, focalizing adverbs and prototypical comparisons. This contribution
 deals with a particular analytic structure of superlative in Italian that is
 still neglected by the literature. This is what we will call Constructional
 Intensifying Adjectives (CIAs), adjectives which modify the intensity of other
 adjectives on the basis of regular semantic patterns, thus giving rise to
 multiword superlative constructions of the type: ADJ(X)+ADJ(INTENS).
