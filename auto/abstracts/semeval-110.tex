This paper describes the systems with which we participated in the task Sentiment Analysis
 in Twitter of SEMEVAL 2013 and specifically
 the Message Polarity Classification. We used
 a 2-stage pipeline approach employing a linear
 SVM classifier at each stage and several
 features including BOW features, POS based
 features and lexicon based features. We have
 also experimented with Naive Bayes classifiers
 trained with BOW features.
