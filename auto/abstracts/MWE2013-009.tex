Cliches, as trite expressions, are predominantly multiword expressions, but not all MWEs are cliches.  We conduct a preliminary examination of the problem of
 determining how cliched a text is, taken as a whole, by comparing it to a
 reference text with respect to the proportion of more-frequent n-grams, as
 measured in an external corpus.  We find that more-frequent n-grams are
 over-represented in cliched text.  We apply this finding to the ``Eumaeus''
 episode of James Joyce's novel Ulysses, which literary scholars believe to be
 written in a deliberately cliched style.
