We propose a method for using discourse relations for polarity detection of tweets. We have focused on unstructured and noisy text like tweets on which
 linguistic tools like parsers and POS-taggers don't work properly. We have
 showed how conjunctions, connectives, modals and conditionals affect the
 sentiments in tweets. We have also handled the commonly used abbreviations,
 slangs and  collocations which are usually used in short text messages like
 tweets. This work focuses on a Web based application which produces results in
 real time. This approach is an extension of the previous work (Mukherjee et al.
 2012).
