This paper presents our system, TJP, which participated in SemEval 2013 Task 2 part A: Contextual Polarity Disambiguation. The goal of this task is to predict
 whether marked contexts are positive, neutral or negative. However, only the
 scores of positive and negative class will be used to calculate the evaluation
 result using F-score. We chose to work as ‘constrained', which used only
 the provided training and development data without additional sentiment
 annotated resources. Our approach considered unigram, bigram and trigram using
 Naïve Bayes training model with the objective of establishing a
 simple approach baseline. Our system achieved F-score 81.23\% and F-score 78.16\%
 in the results for SMS messages and Tweets respectively.
