This paper presents the Tweetsted system implemented for the SemEval 2013 task on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. In particular, we participated in Task B on
 Message Polarity Classification in the Constrained setting. The approach is
 based on the exploitation of various resources such as SentiWordNet and LIWC.
 Official results show that our approach yields a F-score of 0.5976 for Twitter
 messages (11th out of 35) and a F-score of 0.5487 for SMS messages (8th out of
 28 participants).
