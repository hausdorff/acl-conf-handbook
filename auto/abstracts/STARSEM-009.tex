We propose an unsupervised method for automatically calculating word usage similarity in social media data based on topic modelling, which we contrast
 with a baseline distributional method and Weighted Textual Matrix
 Factorisation. We evaluate these methods against a novel dataset made up of
 human ratings over 550 Twitter message pairs annotated for usage similarity for
 a set of 10 nouns. The results show that our topic modelling approach
 outperforms the other two methods.
