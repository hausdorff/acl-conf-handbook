The paper outlines the work carried out at NTNU as part of the *SEM'13 shared task on Semantic Textual Similarity, using an approach which combines shallow
 textual, distributional and knowledge-based features by a support vector
 regression model. Feature sets include 
 (1) aggregated similarity based on named entity recognition with WordNet and
 Levenshtein distance through the calculation of maximum weighted bipartite
 graphs; 
 (2) higher order word co-occurrence similarity using a novel method called 
 ``Multi-sense Random Indexing''; 
 (3) deeper semantic relations based on the RelEx semantic dependency
 relationship extraction system; 
 (4) graph edit-distance on dependency trees; 
 (5) reused features of the TakeLab and DKPro systems from the STS'12 shared
 task. 
 The NTNU systems obtained 9th place overall (5th best team) and 1st place on
 the SMT data set.
