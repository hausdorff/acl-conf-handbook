This paper describes the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) native language identification (NLI) system in the NLI 2013 Shared Task. We
 apply feature selection using a measure based on frequency for the closed track
 and try Capping and Sampling data methods for the open tracks. Our system
 ranked ninth in the closed track, third in open track 1 and forth in open track
