We explore improving parsing social media and other web data by altering the input data, namely by normalizing web text, and by revising output parses.  We
 find that text normalization improves performance, though spell checking has
 more of a mixed impact.  We also find that a very simple tree reviser based on
 grammar comparisons performs slightly but significantly better than the
 baseline and well outperforms a machine learning model.  The results also
 demonstrate that, more              than the size of the training data, the goodness
 of fit
 of the data has a great impact on the parser.
