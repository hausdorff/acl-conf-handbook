This paper presents an approach for gener- ating free paraphrases of compounds (task 4
 at SemEval 2013) by decomposing the train-
 ing data into a collection of templates and
 fillers and recombining/scoring these based on
 a generative language model and discrimina-
 tive MaxEnt reranking.
 The system described in this paper achieved
 the highest official score (with a very small margin) in
 the isomorphic setting of the scorer,
 for which it was optimized, at a disadvantage
 to the non-isomorphic score.
