Using labeled Twitter training data from SemEval-2013, we train both a subjectivity classifier and a polarity classifier separately, and then combine
 the two into a single hierarchical classifier. Using additional unlabeled data
 that is believed to contain sentiment, we allow the polarity classifier to
 continue learning using self-training. The resulting system is capable of
 classifying a document as `neutral`, `positive`, or `negative` with an overall
 accuracy of 61.2\% using our hierarchical Naive Bayes classifier.
