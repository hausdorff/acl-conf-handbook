In this paper, we present a system, UTTime, which we submitted to TempEval-3 for Task C: Annotating temporal relations. The system uses logistic regression
 classifiers and exploits features extracted from a deep syntactic parser,
 including paths between event words in phrase structure trees and their path
 lengths, and paths between event words in predicate-argument structures and
 their subgraphs. UTTime achieved an F1 score of 34.9 based on the graphed-based
 evaluation for Task C (ranked 2nd) and 56.45 for Task C-relation-only (ranked
 1st) in the TempEval-3 evaluation.
