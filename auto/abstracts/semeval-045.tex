This paper describes the specifications and results of UMCC\_DLSI-(EPS) system, which participated in the first Evaluating Phrasal Semantics of SemEval-2013.
 Our supervised system uses different kinds of semantic features to train a
 bagging classifier used to select the correct similarity option. Related to the
 different features we can highlight the resource WordNet used to extract
 semantic relations among words and the use of different algorithms to establish
 semantic similarities. Our system obtains promising results with a precision
 value around 78\% for the English corpus and 71.84\% for the Italian corpus.
