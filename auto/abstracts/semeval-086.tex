We present the results of the Joint Student Response Analysis and 8th Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge, aiming to bring together researchers
 in educational NLP technology and textual entailment. The task of giving
 feedback on student answers requires semantic inference and therefore is
 related to recognizing textual entailment. Thus, we offered to the community a
 5-way student response labeling task, as well as 3-way and 2-way RTE-style
 tasks on educational data. In addition, a partial entailment task was piloted.
 We present and compare results from 9 participating teams, and discuss future
 directions.
