We describe our system for the DDIExtraction-2013 shared task of classifying Drug-Drug interactions (DDIs) given labeled drug mentions. The challenge called
 for a five-way classification of all drug pairs in each sentence: a drug pair
 is either non-interacting, or interacting as one of four types. Our approach
 begins with the use of a two-stage weighted SVM classifier to handle the highly
 unbalanced class distribution: the first stage for a binary classification of
 drug pairs as interacting or non-interacting, and the second stage for further
 classification of interacting pairs from the first stage into one of the four
 interacting types. Our SVM features exploit stemmed words, lemmas, bigrams,
 part of speech tags, verb lists, and similarity measures, among others. For
 each stage, we also developed a set of post-processing rules based on
 observations in the training data. Our best system achieved 0.472 F-measure.
