This paper describes an approach for investigating the representation of events and their distribution in a corpus. We collect and analyze statistics about
 subject-verb-object triplets and their content, which helps us compare corpora
 belonging to the same domain but to different genre/text type. We argue that
 event structure is strongly related to the genre of the corpus, and propose
 statistical properties that are able to capture these genre differences. The
 results obtained can be used for the improvement of Information Extraction.
