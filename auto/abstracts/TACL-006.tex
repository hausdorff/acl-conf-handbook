This paper introduces the problem of predicting semantic relations expressed by prepositions and develops statistical learning models for predicting the
 relations, their arguments and the semantic types of the arguments. First,
 building on the word sense disambiguation task for prepositions, we define an
 inventory of 32 relations by collapsing related senses across prepositions.
 Then, given a preposition in a sentence, we jointly model the preposition
 relation and its arguments, along with their semantic types to support
 predicting the semantic relation. The annotated data, though, only provides
 labels for the relation label, and not the arguments and types. We address this
 by presenting two models for preposition relation labeling. Our generalization
 of latent structure SVM gives an accuracy of 89.43\% on relation labeling.
 Further, by jointly predicting the relation, arguments, and their types along
 with preposition sense, we show that we can not only improve the relation
 accuracy to 90.26\%, but also significantly improve sense prediction accuracy.
