The statistical machine translation (SMT) system heavily depends on the sentence aligned parallel corpus and the target language model. This paper
 points out some of the core issues on switching a language script and its
 repercussion in the phrase based statistical machine translation system
 development. The present
 task reports on the outcome of English-Manipuri language pair phrase based SMT
 task on two aspects --- a) Manipuri using Bengali script, b) Manipuri using
 transliterated Meetei Mayek script. Two independent views on Bengali script
 based SMT and transliterated Meitei Mayek based SMT systems of the training
 data and language models are presented and compared. The impact of various
 language models is commendable in such scenario. The BLEU and NIST score shows
 that Bengali script based phrase based SMT(PBSMT) outperforms over the Meetei
 Mayek based English to Manipuri SMT system. However, subjective evaluation
 shows slight
 variation against the automatic scores.
