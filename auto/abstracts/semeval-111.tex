This paper describes the NILC\_USP system that participated in SemEval-2013 Task
 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. Our system adopts a hybrid classification
 process that uses three classification approaches: rule-based, lexicon-based
 and machine learning approaches. We suggest a pipeline architecture that
 extracts the best characteristics from each classifier. Our system achieved an
 F-score of 56.31\% in the Twitter message-level subtask.
