Despite considerable theoretical and computational work on coreference, deciding when two entities or events are identical is very difficult. In a
 project to build corpora containing coreference links between events, we have
 identified three levels of event identity (full, partial, and none). Event
 coreference annotation on two corpora was performed to validate the findings.
