In this paper, we describe a method for assessing student answers, modeled as a paraphrase identification problem, based on substitution by Basic English
 variants. Basic English paraphrases are acquired from the Simple English
 Wiktionary. Substitutions are applied both on reference answers and student
 answers in order to reduce the diversity of their vocabulary and map them to a
 common vocabulary. The evaluation of our approach on the SemEval 2013 Joint
 Student Response Analysis and 8th Recognizing Textual Entailment Challenge data
 shows promising results and this work is a first step toward an open-domain
 system able to exhibit deep text understanding capabilities.
