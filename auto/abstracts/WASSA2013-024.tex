In this paper, we detail a method for domain specific, multi-category emotion recognition, based on human computation. We create an Amazon Mechanical Turk
 task that elicits emotion labels and phrase-emotion associations from the
 participants. Using the proposed method, we create an emotion lexicon,
 compatible with the 20 emotion categories of the Geneva Emotion Wheel. GEW is
 the first computational resource that can be used to assign emotion labels with
 such a high level of granularity. Our emotion annotation method also produced a
 corpus of emotion labeled sports tweets. We compared the cross-validated
 version of the lexicon with existing resources for both the positive/negative
 and multi-emotion classification problems. We show that the presented
 domain-targeted lexicon outperforms the existing general purpose ones in both
 settings. The performance gains are most pronounced for the fine-grained
 emotion classification, where we achieve an accuracy twice higher than the
 benchmark.
