This paper describes the approach of the Hochschule Hannover to the Semeval 2013 Task Evaluating Phrasal Semantics. In order to compare a single word with
 a two word phrase we compute various distributional similarities, among which a
 new similarity measure, based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence with a correction
 for frequency effects. The classification is done by a support vector machine
 that uses all similarities as features. The approach turned out to be the most
 successful one in the task.
