We present a system submitted in the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task at the Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM 2013).
 Given two short text fragments, the goal of the system is to determine
 their semantic similarity. Our system makes use of three different measures of
 text similarity: word n-gram overlap, character n-gram overlap and semantic
 overlap. Using these measures as features, it trains a support vector
 regression model on SemEval STS 2012 data. This model is then applied on the
 STS 2013 data to compute textual similarities. Two different selections of
 training data result in very different performance levels: while a correlation
 of 0.4135 with gold standards was observed in the official evaluation (ranked
 63rd among all systems) for one selection, the other resulted in a correlation
 of 0.5352 (that would rank 21st).
