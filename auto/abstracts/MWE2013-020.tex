This research focuses on determining semantic compositionality of word expressions using
 word space models (WSMs). We discuss
 previous works employing WSMs and present
 differences in the proposed approaches which
 include types of WSMs, corpora, preprocessing
 techniques, methods for determining compositionality,
 and evaluation testbeds.
 
 We also present results of our own approach
 for determining the semantic compositionality
 based on comparing distributional vectors of
 expressions and their components. The vectors
 were obtained by Latent Semantic Analysis
 (LSA) applied to the ukWaC corpus. Our
 results outperform those of all the participants
 in the Distributional Semantics and Compositionality
 (DISCO) 2011 shared task.
