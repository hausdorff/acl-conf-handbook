Soft cardinality has been shown to be a very strong text-overlapping baseline for the task of measuring semantic textual similarity (STS), obtaining 3rd
 place in SemEval-2012. At *SEM-2013 shared task, beside the plain
 text-overlapping approach, we tested within soft cardinality two distributional
 word-similarity functions derived from the ukWack corpus. Unfortunately, we
 combined these measures with other features using regression, obtaining
 positions 18th, 22nd and 23rd among the 90 participants systems in the official
 ranking. Already after the release of the gold standard annotations of the test
 data, we observed that using only the similarity measures without combining
 them with other features would have obtained positions 6th, 7th and 8th;
 moreover, an arithmetic average of these similarity measures would have been
 4th(mean=0.5747). This paper describes both the 3 systems as they were
 submitted and the similarity measures that would obtained those better results.
