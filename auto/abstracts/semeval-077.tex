Most work on word sense disambiguation has assumed that word usages are best labeled with a single sense.  However, contextual ambiguity or fine-grained
 senses can potentially enable multiple sense interpretations of a usage.  We
 present a new SemEval task for evaluating Word Sense Induction and
 Disambiguation systems in a setting where instances may be labeled with
 multiple senses, weighted by their applicability.  Four teams submitted nine
 systems, which were evaluated in two settings.
