This article describes our novel approach to the automated detection and analysis of meta-phors in text. We employ robust, quantitative language
 processing to implement a system prototype combined with sound social science
 methods for validation. We show results in 4 different languages and discuss
 how our methods are a significant step forward from previously established
 techniques of metaphor identification. We use Topical Structure and Tracking,
 an Imageability score, and innova-tive methods to build an effective metaphor
 identification system that is fully automated and performs well over baseline.
