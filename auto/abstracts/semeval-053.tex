Sentiment Analysis in Twitter has become an important task due to the huge user-generated
 content published over such media. Such
 analysis could be useful for many domains
 such as Marketing, Finance, Politics, and Social.
 We propose to use many features in order
 to improve a trained classifier of Twitter messages;
 these features extend the feature vector
 of uni-gram model by the concepts extracted
 from DBpedia, the verb groups and the similar
 adjectives extracted from WordNet, the Sentifeatures
 extracted using SentiWordNet and
 some useful domain specific features. We also
 built a dictionary for emotion icons, abbreviation
 and slang words in tweets which is useful
 before extending the tweets with different features.
 Adding these features has improved the
 f-measure accuracy 2\% with SVM and 4\%
 with NaiveBayes.
