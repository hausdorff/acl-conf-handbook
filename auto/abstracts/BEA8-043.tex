We show that it is possible to learn to identify, with high accuracy, the native language of English test takers from the content of the essays they
 write.                    Our method uses standard text classification
 techniques based on multiclass logistic regression, combining individually weak
 indicators to predict the most probable native language from a set of 11
 possibilities. We describe the various features used for classification, as
 well as the settings of the classifier that yielded the highest accuracy.
