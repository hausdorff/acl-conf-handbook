We present the CSF - Common Semantic Features method for metaphor detection. This method has two distinguishing characteristics: it is cross-lingual and it
 does not rely on the availability of extensive manually-compiled lexical
 resources in target languages other than English. A metaphor detecting
 classifier is trained on English samples and then applied to the target
 language. The method includes procedures for obtaining semantic features from
 sentences in the target language. Our experiments with Russian and English
 sentences show comparable results, supporting our hypothesis that a CSF-based
 classifier can be applied across languages. We obtain state-of-the-art
 performance in both languages.
