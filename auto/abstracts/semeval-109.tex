Automatic relation extraction provides great support for scientists and database curators in dealing with the extensive amount of biomedical textual
 data. The DDIExtraction 2013 challenge poses the task of detecting drug-drug
 interactions and further categorizing them into one of the four relation
 classes. We
 present our machine learning system which utilizes lexical, syntactical and
 semantic based feature sets. Resampling, balancing and ensemble learning
 experiments are performed to infer the best configuration. For general
 drug-drug relation extraction, the system achieves 70.4\\% in F1 score.
