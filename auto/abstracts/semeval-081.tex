In this paper, we describe our system for the SemEval-2013 Task 2, Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. We formed features that take into account the context of
 the expression and take a supervised approach towards subjectivity and polarity
 classification. Experiments were performed on the features to find out whether
 they were more suited for subjectivity or polarity Classification. We tested
 our model for sentiment polarity classification on Twitter as well as SMS chat
 expressions, analyzed their F-measure scores and drew some interesting
 conclusions from them.
