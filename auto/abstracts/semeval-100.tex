This paper describes The University of Melbourne NLP group submission   to the Cross-lingual Textual Entailment shared task, our first
   tentative attempt at the task. The approach involves using parallel
   corpora and automatic word alignment to align text fragment pairs, and
   statistics based on unaligned words as features to classify items as
   forward and backward before a compositional combination into the final
   four classes, as well as experiments with additional string similarity
   features.
