High frequency can convert a word sequence into a multiword expression (MWE), i.e., a collocation. In this paper, we use collocations as well as
 syntactically-flexible, lexicalized phrases to analyze â€˜job specification
 docu-ments' (a kind of corporate technical docu-ment) for subsequent
 acquisition of automated knowledge elicitation. We propose the definition of
 structural and functional patterns of specific corporate documents by analyzing
 the contexts and sections in which the expression occurs. Such patterns and its
 automated processing are the basis for identifying organizational domain
 knowledge and business information which is used later for the first instances
 of requirement elicitation processes in software engineering.
