The paper describes experiments using grid searches over various combinations of machine learning algorithms, features and preprocessing strategies in order
 to produce the optimal systems for sentiment classification of microblog
 messages.
 The approach is fairly domain independent, as demonstrated by the systems
 achieving quite competitive results when applied to short text message data,
 i.e., input they were not originally trained on.
