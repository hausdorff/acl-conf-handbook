This paper discusses user study outcomes with teachers who used SYSTEM , a web-based teacher professional development (TPD) appli-cation designed to
 enhance teachers' linguistic awareness, and support teachers in the
 development of language-based instructional scaffolding (support) for their
 English language learners (ELL). System development was grounded in literature
 that supports the notion that instruction incorporating language support for
 ELLs can improve their accessibility to content-area classroom texts ---in
 terms of access to content, and improvement of language skills. Measurement
 outcomes of user piloting with teachers in a TPD setting indicated that
 application use increased teachers' linguistic knowledge and awareness, and
 their ability to develop appropriate language-based instruction for ELLs.
 Instruction developed during the pilot was informed by the application's
 linguistic analysis feedback, provided by natural language processing
 capabilities in SYSTEM.
