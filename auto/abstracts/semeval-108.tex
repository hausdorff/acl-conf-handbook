This paper describes a system for temporal processing of text, which participated in the
 Temporal Evaluations 2013 campaign. The
 system employs a number of machine learning
 classifiers to perform the core tasks of: identification
 of time expressions and events, recognition
 of their attributes, and estimation of
 temporal links between recognized events and
 times. The central feature of the proposed system
 is temporal parsing --- an approach which
 identifies temporal relation arguments (event-event
 and event-timex pairs) and the semantic
 label of the relation as a single decision.
