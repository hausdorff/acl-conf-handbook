Automatic metaphor identification and interpretation in text have been traditionally considered as two separate tasks in natural language processing
 (NLP) and addressed individually within computational frameworks. However,
 cognitive evidence suggests that humans are likely to perform these two tasks
 simultaneously, as part of a holistic metaphor comprehension process. We
 present a novel method that performs metaphor identification through its
 interpretation, being the first one in NLP to combine the two tasks in one
 step. It outperforms the previous approaches to metaphor identification both in
 terms of accuracy and coverage, as well as providing an interpretation for each
 identified expression.
