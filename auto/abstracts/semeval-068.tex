In this paper we describe our Semeval-2013 task on Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation within an end-user application, namely Web search result
 clustering and diversification. Given a target query, induction and
 disambiguation systems are requested to cluster and diversify the search
 results returned by a search engine for that query. The task enables the
 end-to-end evaluation and comparison of systems.
