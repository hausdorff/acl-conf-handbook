We evaluate a naive machine learning ap- proach to sentiment classification focused on
 Twitter in the context of the sentiment anal-
 ysis task of SemEval-2013. We employ a
 classifier based on the Random Forests algo-
 rithm to determine whether a tweet expresses
 overall positive, negative or neutral sentiment.
 The classifier was trained only with the pro-
 vided dataset and uses as main features word
 vectors and lexicon word counts. Our aver-
 age F-score for all three classes on the Twitter
 evaluation dataset was 51.55\%. The average
 F-score of both positive and negative classes
 was 45.01\%. For the optional SMS evalua-
 tion dataset our overall average F-score was
 58.82\%. The average between positive and
 negative F-scores was 50.11\%.
