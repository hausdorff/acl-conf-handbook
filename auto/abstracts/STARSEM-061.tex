The Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task examines semantic similarity at a sentence-level.  We explored three representations of semantics (implicit or
 explicit): named entities, semantic vectors, and structured vectorial
 semantics.  From a DKPro baseline, we also performed feature selection and used
 source-specific linear regression models to combine our features. Our systems
 placed 5th, 6th, and 8th among 90 submitted systems.
