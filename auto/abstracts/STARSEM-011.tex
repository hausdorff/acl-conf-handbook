We created a dataset of syntactic-ngrams (counted dependency-tree fragments) based on a corpus of 3.5 million English books. 
    The dataset includes over 10 billion distinct items covering a wide range of
 syntactic configurations.
    It also includes temporal information,
    facilitating new kinds of research into lexical semantics over time. 
    This paper describes the dataset, the syntactic representation, and the
 kinds of information provided.
