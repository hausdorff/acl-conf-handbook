This paper presents a supervised machine learning approach that uses a machine learn-ing algorithm called Random Forest for recognition of Bengali noun-noun
 compounds as multiword expression (MWE) from Bengali corpus. Our proposed
 approach to MWE rec-ognition has two steps: (1) extraction of can-didate
 multi-word expressions using Chunk information and various heuristic rules and
 (2) training the machine learning algorithm to recognize a candidate multi-word
 expression as Multi-word expression or not. A variety of association measures,
 syntactic and linguistic clues are used as features for identifying MWEs. The
 proposed system is tested on a Bengali corpus for identifying noun-noun
 compound MWEs from the corpus.
