Tree Substitution Grammar rules are an large and expressive class of features capable of representing syntactic and lexical patterns that provide evidence of
 an author's native language.  However, this class of features can be applied to
 any general constituent based model of grammar and previous work has done
 little to explore these options, relying primarily on the common Penn Treebank
 annotation standard.
 In this work we contrast the performance of syntactic features for Native
 Language Indentification using five
 different formalisms.  The use of different formalisms captures complementary
 information from second language data, 
 and can be used in combination to yield classification performance superior to
 any formalism taken on its own.
