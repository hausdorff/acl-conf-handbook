We describe a number of techniques for automatically deriving lists of common and proper nouns, and show that the distinction between the two can be made
 automatically using a vector space model learning algorithm. We present a
 direct evaluation on the British National Corpus, and application based
 evaluations on Twitter messages and on automatic speech recognition (where the
 system could be employed to restore case).
