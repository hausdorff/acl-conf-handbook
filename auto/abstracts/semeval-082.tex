Word sense induction aims to discover differ- ent senses of a word from a corpus by us-
 ing unsupervised learning approaches. Once a
 sense inventory is obtained for an ambiguous
 word, word sense discrimination approaches
 choose the best-fitting single sense for a given
 context from the induced sense inventory.
 However, there may not be a clear distinction
 between one sense and another, although for
 a context, more than one induced sense can
 be suitable. Graded word sense method al-
 lows for labeling a word in more than one
 sense. In contrast to the most common ap-
 proach which is to apply clustering or graph
 partitioning on a representation of first or sec-
 ond order co-occurrences of a word, we pro-
 pose a system that creates a substitute vec-
 tor for each target word from the most likely
 substitutes suggested by a statistical language
 model. Word samples are then taken accord-
 ing to probabilities of these substitutes and the
 results of the co-occurrence model are clus-
 tered. This approach outperforms the other
 systems on graded word sense induction task
 in SemEval-2013.
