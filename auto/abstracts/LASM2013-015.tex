Although the ideal length of summaries differs greatly from topic to topic on Twitter, previous work have only generated summaries of a fixed length. In this
 paper, we propose an event-graph based method that is able to detect
 fine-grained real-world events and create summaries of variable length
 accordingly for different topics. Our method takes advantage of the redundant
 and self-contained nature of tweets to not only rank but also partition the
 events by PageRank-like algorithm. Our preliminary results show that by
 utilizing information extraction techniques which are judged by human
 annotators to be more relevant and consise than SumBasic. We also provide a
 brief survey of datasets and evaluation design
 for previous work to highlight the need of developing a standard evaluation for
 the field.
