Automated feedback on writing may be a useful complement to teacher comments in the process of learning a foreign language. This paper presents a
 self-assessment and tutoring system which combines an holistic score with
 detection and correction of frequent errors and furthermore provides a
 qualitative assessment of each individual sentence, thus making the language
 learner aware of potentially problematic areas rather than providing a panacea.
 The system has been tested by learners in a range of educational institutions,
 and their feedback has guided its development.
