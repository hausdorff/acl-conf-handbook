Sentiment analysis refers to automatically extracting the sentiment present in a given natural
 language text. We present our participation
 to the SemEval2013 competition, in the sentiment
 analysis of Twitter and SMS messages.
 Our approach for this task is the combination
 of two sentiment analysis subsystems which
 are combined together to build the final system.
 Both subsystems use supervised learning
 using features based on various polarity lexicons.
