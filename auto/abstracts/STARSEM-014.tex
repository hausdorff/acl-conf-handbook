Implicit arguments are a discourse-level phenomenon that has not been extensively studied in semantic processing. One reason for this lies in the
 scarce amount of annotated data sets available. We argue that more data of this
 kind would be helpful to improve existing approaches to linking implicit
 arguments in discourse and to enable more in-depth studies of the phenomenon
 itself. In this paper, we present a range of studies that empirically validate
 this claim. Our contributions are threefold: we present a heuristic approach to
 automatically identify implicit arguments and their antecedents by exploiting
 comparable texts; we show how the induced data can be used as training data for
 improving existing argument linking models; finally, we present a novel
 approach to modeling local coherence that extends previous approaches by taking
 into account non-explicit entity references.
