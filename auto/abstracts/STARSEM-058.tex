We approach the typed-similarity task using several kinds of heuristic similarity techniques for each type of similarity, based on the information of
 appropriated metadata fields. In addition we train a linear regressor for each
 type of similarity. The results indicate that the linear regression is key for
 good performance. Our best system ranked third in the task.
