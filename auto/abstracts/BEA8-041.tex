This paper describes our approaches to Native Language Identification (NLI) for the NLI shared task 2013. NLI as a sub area of author profiling focuses on
 identifying the first language of an author given a text in his second
 language. Researchers have reported several sets of features that have achieved
 relatively good performance in this task. The type of features used in such
 works are: lexical, syntactic and stylistic features, dependency parsers,
 psycholinguistic features and grammatical errors. In our approaches, we 
 selected lexical and syntactic features based on n-grams of characters, words, 
 Penn TreeBank (PTB) and Universal Parts Of Speech (POS) tagsets, and perplexity
 values of character of n-grams to build four different models. We also combine
 all the four models using an ensemble based approach to get the final result.
 We evaluated our approach over a set of 11 native languages reaching 75\%
 accuracy.
