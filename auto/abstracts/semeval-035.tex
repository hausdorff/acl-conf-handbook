This paper describes our submission for SemEval2013 Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.
 For the limited data condition we use a lexicon-based model.
 The model uses an affective lexicon automatically generated from a very large
 corpus of raw web data.
 Statistics are calculated over the word and bigram affective ratings and used
 as features of a Naive Bayes tree model.
 For the unconstrained data scenario we combine the lexicon-based model with a
 classifier built on maximum entropy language models and trained on a large
 external dataset.
 The two models are fused at the posterior level to produce a final output.
 The approach proved successful, reaching rankings of 9th and 4th in the twitter
 sentiment analysis constrained and unconstrained scenario respectively, despite
 using only lexical features.
