Based on a lexicon of Portuguese MWE, this presentation focuses on an ongoing work that aims at the creation of a typology that de-scribes these expressions
 taking into account their semantic, syntactic and pragmatic prop-erties. We
 also plan to annotate each MWE-entry in the mentioned lexicon according to the
 information obtained from that typology. Our objective is to create a valuable
 resource, which will allow for the automatic identifica-tion MWE in running
 text and for a deeper understanding of these expressions in their context.
