We propose a minimally supervised method for multilingual paraphrase extraction from definition sentences on the Web. Hashimoto et al. (2011) extracted
 paraphrases from Japanese definition sentences on the Web, assuming that
 definition sentences defining the same concept tend to contain paraphrases.
 However, their method requires manually annotated data and is language
 dependent. We extend their framework and develop a minimally supervised method
 applicable to multiple languages. Our experiments show that our method is
 comparable to Hashimoto et al.'s for Japanese and outperforms previous
 unsupervised methods for English, Japanese, and Chinese, and that our method
 extracts 10,000 paraphrases with 92% precision for English, 82.5% precision for
 Japanese, and 82% precision for Chinese.
