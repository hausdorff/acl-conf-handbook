This paper reports on our work in the NLI shared task 2013 on Native Language Identification. The task is to automatically detect the native language of the
 TOEFL essays authors in a set of given test documents in English. The task
 was solved by the system that used PPM compression algorithm based on n-gram
 statistical model. We have submitted four runs, word-based PPM algorithm with
 normalization and without, character-based PPM algorithm with normalization
 and without. The worst result was obtained on training and testing data during
 evaluation procedure using character-based PPM method and normalization:
 accuracy = 31.9\%; the best one was: macroaverage F-measure = 0.708 with
 word-based PPMC algorithm without normalization.
