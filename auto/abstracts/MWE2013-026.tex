Starting form the observation that multiword expressions' morphological variability can be treated via homogeneous syntactic patterns, we propose (i) a
 scoring method for selecting precise variation patterns automatically and (ii)
 introduce the idea of a repository of patterns where corpus-derived frequencies
 and ranking measures are included. Pattern selection is evaluated on manually
 annotated data. Experiments are run on Italian MWEs.
