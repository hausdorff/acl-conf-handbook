We describe a novel approach to combining lexicalized, POS-based and syntactic tree-based word reordering in a phrase-based machine translation system.
 Our results show that each of the presented reordering methods leads to
 improved translation quality on its own. The strengths however can be combined
 to achieve further improvements.
 We present experiments on German-English and German-French translation. We
 report improvements of 0.7 BLEU points by adding tree-based and lexicalized
 reordering. Up to 1.1 BLEU points can be gained by rule-based reordering over a
 baseline with lexicalized reordering.
 A human analysis, comparing subjective translation quality as well as a
 detailed error analysis show the impact of our presented tree-based rules in
 terms of improved sentence quality and reduction of errors related to missing
 verbs and verb positions.
