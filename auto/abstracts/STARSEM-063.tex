This paper describes the system used by the LIPN team in the Semantic Textual Similarity task at SemEval 2013. It uses a support vector regression model,
 combining different text similarity measures that constitute the features.
 These measures include simple distances like Levenshtein edit distance, cosine,
 Named Entities overlap and more complex distances like Explicit Semantic
 Analysis, WordNet-based similarity, IR-based similarity, and a similarity
 measure based on syntactic dependencies.
