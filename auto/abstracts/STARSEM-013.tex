Existing semantic parsing research has steadily improved accuracy on a few domains
 and their corresponding databases. This paper
 introduces FreeParser, a system that trains on
 one domain and one set of predicate and constant
 symbols, and then can parse sentences
 for any new domain, including sentences that
 refer to symbols never seen during training.
 FreeParser uses a domain-independent architecture
 to automatically identify sentences
 relevant to each new database symbol, which
 it uses to supplement its manually-annotated
 training data from the training domain. In
 cross-domain experiments involving 23
 domains, FreeParser can parse sentences for
 which it has seen comparable unannotated
 sentences with an F1 of 0.71.
