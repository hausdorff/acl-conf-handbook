This paper describes the CoMeT system, our contribution to the SemEval 2013 Task 7 challenge, focusing on the task of automatically assessing student
 answers to factual questions. CoMeT is based on a meta-classifier that uses the
 outputs of the sub-systems we developed: CoMiC, CoSeC, and three shallower bag
 approaches. We sketch the functionality of all sub-systems and evaluate their
 performance
 against the official test set of the challenge. CoMeT obtained the best result
 (73.1\% accuracy) for the 3-way unseen answers in Beetle among all challenge
 participants. We also discuss possible improvements and directions for future
 research.
