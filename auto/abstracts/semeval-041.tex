The Duluth systems that participated in task 11 of SemEval--2013 carried out word sense induction (WSI) in order to cluster Web search results. They relied
 on an approach that represented Web snippets using second-order co-occurrences.
 These systems were all implemented using SenseClusters, a freely available open
 source software package.
