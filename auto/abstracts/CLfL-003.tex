We present CoocViewer, a graphical analysis tool for the purpose of quantitative literary analysis, and demonstrate its use on a corpus of crime
 novels. The tool displays words, their significant co-occurrences, and contains
 a new visualization for significant concordances. Contexts of words and
 co-occurrences
 can be displayed. After reviewing previous research and current challenges in
 the newly emerging field of quantitative literary research, we demonstrate how
 CoocViewer allows comparative research on literary corpora in a
 project-specific study, and how we can confirm or enhance our hypotheses
 through quantitative literary analysis.
