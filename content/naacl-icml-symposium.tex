\subsection*{Description}

Following the success of the joint NLP/ML symposium held in 2011, the second joint symposium on
Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning will be held in Atlanta, Georgia. The goal of the
symposium is to foster communication and collaboration between researchers in these synergistic
areas, taking advantage of the nearby locations of NAACL-HLT 2013
(\url{http://naacl2013.naacl.org/}) and ICML 2013 (\url{http://icml.cc/2013/}). It will bring
together members of the Association for Computational Linguistics (\url{http://www.aclweb.org/}),
and the International Machine Learning Society (\url{http://www.machinelearning.org/}).

The symposium will be held on June 15, 2013 as part of several joint NAACL/ICML events running June
14--16. More information can be found on the NAACL
(\url{http://naacl2013.naacl.org/WorkshopsAccepted.aspx}) and ICML
(\url{http://icml.cc/2013/?page_id=41}) websites.

\subsection*{Topics}

The symposium will feature a series of invited talks from top researchers covering several recent,
exciting topics that are relevant to both Machine Learning and NLP. These areas include but are not
limited to: structured prediction and inference, log-linear models, Bayesian modeling, deep
learning, sparse representations, scalable probabilistic inference, semi-supervised and unsupervised
training. Applications areas include learning language in context, language modeling, machine
translation, learning semantic representations, topic modeling, among others.
